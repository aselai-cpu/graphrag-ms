Specifically, Temasek Holdings' management approach was considered as a model for Chinese state business reforms. China studied Temasek's structure and operational methodology as it sought to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of its own state-owned enterprises. This interest stemmed from China's desire to allow professional managers to handle state business operations rather than relying solely on government bureaucrats or political appointees.\n\nTemasek Holdings' appeal as a model lies in its unique position as a state-owned investment holding company that operates on commercial principles while remaining under government ownership. The company demonstrates how a state can maintain ownership of strategic assets while delegating day-to-day management to professional executives who are accountable for financial performance and operate according to market principles.
