His connection to the capital city has evolved significantly throughout his political career.\n\nIn his youth, Xi fled from Liangjiahe back to Beijing after only three months, but this escape attempt was unsuccessful as he was caught and detained. This early incident demonstrates the challenges he faced before establishing himself in China's political hierarchy.\n\nXi's political ascent in Beijing began in earnest when he gained a foothold in the city's political circles after joining the Central Committee in 1997. This marked a crucial turning point in his career, establishing him as a significant figure within China's governing apparatus. From this foundation, he eventually rose to lead Beijing's central government, where he now exercises considerable policy control through what is characterized as \"top-level design\" - a comprehensive approach to governance and policy implementation.\n\nAs a central government leader based in Beijing, Xi has made critical decisions on major national issues, including the country's Covid-19 response. His leadership style emphasizes political discipline, which has significantly influenced Beijing's policies on information control and national security. These demands for political discipline have shaped how the capital's government approaches sensitive matters of state security and public information management.\n\nIn his current role, Xi operates from Beijing as the center of his political power, where he receives foreign leaders and directs diplomatic operations. The capital serves as the hub for China's international relations under his leadership, positioning him at the nexus of both domestic and foreign policy.\n\nXi's prominence in Beijing has also been subject to public attention and speculation. Notably, he resurfaced at a Beijing university after a two-week disappearance, an event that likely generated significant interest given his central role in Chinese governance.\n\nThe connection between Xi and Beijing extends to his family as well. His half-sister attended a confab in Beijing, indicating that the capital city serves not only as his political base but also as a location for family connections and activities.\n\nThroughout his journey from a young man attempting to flee back to Beijing to becoming the central government leader who operates from and controls policy in the capital, Xi's relationship with Beijing has been transformative.
