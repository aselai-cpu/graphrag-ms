Both Mao and Deng possessed revolutionary pedigree and wielded significant personal clout, distinguishing them from subsequent leaders like Xi Jinping. Their legitimacy was rooted in their direct participation in the Chinese Revolution, which granted them unparalleled authority and influence.\n\nThe relationship between these two leaders was complex and often turbulent. During Mao's Cultural Revolution, Deng Xiaoping was twice purged from power, reflecting the political volatility and ideological struggles of that era. Despite these setbacks, Deng demonstrated remarkable political resilience and eventually came to power after Mao's death, succeeding him as a paramount leader of China.\n\nDeng Xiaoping's leadership marked a significant departure from Mao's approach. While Mao held formal positions and ruled directly, Deng adopted a different strategy, often ruling from behind the scenes even while holding the crucial position of Central Military Commission chairmanship. This position gave him control over the armed forces, which proved essential to maintaining his influence and authority.\n\nOne of Deng's most significant contributions to Chinese governance was the development of new succession norms. In contrast to Mao's lifetime rule, Deng established mechanisms and precedents for leadership transition that would shape Chinese politics for decades.
