The organization has played a significant role in measuring and documenting global attitudes toward China through systematic polling and research initiatives.\n\nIn 2020, the Pew Research Center conducted notable polls that revealed record unfavorable views of China among international populations. This research captured a significant moment in global public opinion, documenting historically high levels of negative sentiment toward China during that period. The timing of these findings coincided with various global events and developments that may have influenced international perceptions.\n\nBeyond the specific 2020 polling data, the Pew Research Center has maintained an ongoing commitment to studying and measuring international views and perceptions of China more broadly.
