These connections demonstrate the province's importance in China's reform trajectory and Xi's political development.\n\nIn summer 1978, during a formative period in his early political career, Xi Jinping visited his father in Guangdong and participated in an inspection tour that allowed him to observe front-line politics firsthand.

When Xi became general secretary, he chose Guangdong province as the destination for his first trip outside Beijing in his new leadership role. This decision was highly symbolic, as it deliberately echoed Deng Xiaoping's famous southern tour to Guangdong. Deng's 1992 southern tour had been a pivotal moment in Chinese history, where he reinvigorated economic reforms and opening-up policies after a period of uncertainty. By selecting Guangdong for his inaugural trip as general secretary, Xi Jinping sent a clear signal about his commitment to continuing China's reform path and acknowledged the province's historical role as a pioneer in economic transformation.\n\nDuring his inspection in Guangdong as leader, Xi Jinping emphasized the importance of continuing reforms, reinforcing his message that reform and opening up would remain central to China's development strategy under his leadership. This emphasis on reform continuity while visiting the birthplace of China's economic reforms demonstrated both respect for the legacy of previous leaders and Xi's intention to advance his own vision for the country's future.\n\nGuangdong province itself has been at the forefront of China's economic reforms since the late 1970s, serving as a testing ground for market-oriented policies and special economic zones.
