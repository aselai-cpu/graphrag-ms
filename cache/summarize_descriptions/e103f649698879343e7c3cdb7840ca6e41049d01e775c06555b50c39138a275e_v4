His career in journalism came to an abrupt end in 2014 when he was forced out of the profession, marking a significant turning point in his professional life.\n\nLuo Changping's legal troubles began when he publicly criticized the Chinese patriotic war film \"The Battle at Lake Changjin.\" This criticism led to his detention on charges of defaming heroes and martyrs, a serious offense under Chinese law that protects the reputation and honor of individuals deemed national heroes. The charges specifically related to infringement upon the honor and reputation of heroes and martyrs, reflecting China's legal framework that criminalizes speech considered disrespectful to those recognized for their service to the nation.\n\nFollowing his detention, Luo Changping faced both criminal prosecution and civil public-interest litigation. He was arrested and subsequently tried in a first-instance trial that addressed both the criminal charges of infringing upon the honor and reputation of heroes and martyrs, as well as related civil matters. The legal proceedings resulted in his conviction, and he was sentenced to seven months in jail for his comments about the film.\n\nLuo Changping's case represents a notable example of the intersection between journalism, free speech, and China's laws protecting the reputation of national heroes and martyrs. His trajectory from being an investigative reporter known for anti-corruption work to becoming a defendant in a high-profile case illustrates the risks faced by journalists and commentators in China who engage in controversial speech, particularly when it involves criticism of state-sanctioned narratives or patriotic productions.\n\nThe case also highlights the use of both criminal and civil legal mechanisms in China to address speech deemed offensive to national heroes, demonstrating how public-interest litigation can be employed alongside criminal prosecution in such matters.
