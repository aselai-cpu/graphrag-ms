This form of public denunciation became a hallmark of their activities during this period.\n\nThe nature of the Red Guards' involvement was notably violent and aggressive. They functioned as violent vigilantes who carried out attacks against those targeted as counter-revolutionaries, class enemies, or individuals associated with the \"Four Olds\" (old customs, old culture, old habits, and old ideas).
