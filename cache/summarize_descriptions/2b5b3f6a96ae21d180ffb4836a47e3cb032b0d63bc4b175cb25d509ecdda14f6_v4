Its establishment reflects the Chinese government's strategic approach to controlling historical interpretation and ensuring that historical scholarship aligns with the current leadership's political objectives and ideological framework. By operating under the Central Propaganda Department, the institution plays a direct role in shaping public understanding of history in ways that support the state's narrative goals.\n\nThe organization maintains an active public presence through social media, specifically operating a Weibo account where it publishes content related to various historical topics.
