Through a combination of structural reforms and personnel purges, Xi has successfully tightened his grip on this powerful body to ensure party loyalty and strengthen his personal authority.\n\nThe Central Political and Legal Affairs Commission is a critical institution within the Chinese Communist Party structure, responsible for overseeing the country's security apparatus, judicial system, law enforcement, and legal affairs. Recognizing its strategic importance, Xi Jinping has made controlling this commission a priority in his broader campaign to centralize power.\n\nXi's approach to asserting control over the commission has been multifaceted. He directed extensive purges targeting officials within the political-legal system, removing individuals whose loyalty was questionable or who represented potential challenges to his authority. These purges served the dual purpose of eliminating opposition and sending a clear message about the consequences of insufficient party loyalty.\n\nIn addition to personnel changes, Xi implemented structural reforms to the commission itself. Notably, he downgraded the role of the zhengfawei secretary, reducing the position's influence and autonomy. This institutional restructuring was a strategic move to prevent the commission from becoming an independent power center that could potentially challenge his leadership.\n\nThe purges conducted under Xi's direction were comprehensive, affecting multiple ranks within the commission and the broader political-legal system. By systematically removing officials and replacing them with loyalists, Xi ensured that the commission would function as an instrument of his will rather than as a semi-autonomous body.\n\nThese actions reflect Xi Jinping's broader governance strategy of centralizing authority and demanding absolute loyalty to both the party and his personal leadership. The tightening of control over the Central Political and Legal Affairs Commission has been particularly significant given the body's oversight of China's security and legal apparatus, which are essential tools for maintaining political control and social stability.\n\nThrough these combined measures—personnel purges, structural downgrading of key positions, and institutional reforms—Xi Jinping has successfully transformed the Central Political and Legal Affairs Commission into a more compliant and centrally controlled entity, firmly under his authority and aligned with his vision for party governance.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"citations": null, "thinking_blocks": null}}}], "created": 1769998611, "model": "claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 496, "prompt_tokens": 244, "total_tokens": 740, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": null, "audio_tokens": null, "reasoning_tokens": null, "rejected_prediction_tokens": null, "text_tokens": 496}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null, "cache_creation_tokens": 0, "cache_creation_token_details": {"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens": 0, "ephemeral_1h_input_tokens": 0}}, "cache_creation_input_tokens": 0, "cache_read_input_tokens": 0}, "formatted_response": null, "content": "# Comprehensive Summary: Xi Jinping and the Central Political and Legal Affairs Commission\n\nXi Jinping has undertaken systematic efforts to consolidate his control over the Central Political and Legal Affairs Commission (also known as the zhengfawei), which oversees China's political-legal system.
