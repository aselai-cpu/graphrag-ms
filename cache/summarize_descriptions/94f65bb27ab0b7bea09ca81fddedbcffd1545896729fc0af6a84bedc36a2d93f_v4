The relationship between these two nations encompasses multiple dimensions, including economic ties, diplomatic engagement, and maritime territorial disputes.\n\nThe most significant point of contention between Brunei and China involves overlapping territorial claims in the South China Sea. Brunei claims sovereignty over certain maritime areas and features in the southern part of the South China Sea, particularly around Louisa Reef and parts of the Spratly Islands region. These claims overlap with China's expansive nine-dash line claim, which encompasses approximately 90% of the South China Sea. Despite this territorial dispute, Brunei has generally adopted a more measured and diplomatic approach compared to other claimant states in the region, such as the Philippines and Vietnam.\n\nBeyond the territorial issues, Brunei maintains active diplomatic and economic relations with China. As a small nation with significant energy resources, Brunei has developed trade relationships with China, which represents an important economic partner. The two countries engage in bilateral cooperation across various sectors, and China has become an increasingly important trading partner for Brunei over the years.\n\nBrunei's approach to managing its relationship with China reflects the delicate balancing act that many Southeast Asian nations must perform. While the territorial disputes in the South China Sea remain unresolved, Brunei has generally avoided aggressive confrontation with China over these claims. Instead, the nation has pursued a strategy of maintaining cordial diplomatic relations while quietly asserting its territorial rights. This pragmatic approach allows Brunei to benefit from economic cooperation with China while preserving its sovereignty claims.\n\nAs a member of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), Brunei also engages with China through multilateral frameworks. The country supports ASEAN's efforts to establish a Code of Conduct in the South China Sea, which aims to manage tensions and prevent conflicts in the disputed waters.\n\nIn summary, the relationship between Brunei and China is multifaceted, combining elements of cooperation and competition. While overlapping territorial claims in the South China Sea represent a persistent challenge, both nations have maintained diplomatic relations and economic ties. Brunei's approach emphasizes peaceful coexistence and diplomatic engagement, even as it maintains its territorial claims in the contested maritime region.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"citations": null, "thinking_blocks": null}}}], "created": 1769998758, "model": "claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 500, "prompt_tokens": 190, "total_tokens": 690, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": null, "audio_tokens": null, "reasoning_tokens": null, "rejected_prediction_tokens": null, "text_tokens": 500}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null, "cache_creation_tokens": 0, "cache_creation_token_details": {"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens": 0, "ephemeral_1h_input_tokens": 0}}, "cache_creation_input_tokens": 0, "cache_read_input_tokens": 0}, "formatted_response": null, "content": "# Comprehensive Summary: Brunei-China Relations\n\nBrunei and China maintain diplomatic relations that are characterized by both cooperation and territorial complexities in the South China Sea region.
