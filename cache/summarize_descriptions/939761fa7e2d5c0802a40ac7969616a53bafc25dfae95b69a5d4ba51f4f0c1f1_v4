When Xi Jinping assumed power, he inherited a political landscape still influenced by Jiang Zemin, who had maintained considerable influence even after his formal retirement. Xi faced potential meddling from Jiang Zemin and his network of protégés, who retained positions of power throughout the Chinese political and military establishment.\n\nTo consolidate his own authority, Xi Jinping undertook decisive action against Jiang Zemin's power base. Most notably, he dismissed high-ranking generals who were close to Jiang Zemin, systematically replacing Jiang's associates in the military with his own loyalists. This purge of the military leadership represented a critical step in Xi's efforts to establish independent control over the armed forces and eliminate potential sources of opposition.\n\nWhile Xi Jinping followed Jiang Zemin's leadership in certain respects, he distinguished himself by pursuing far more extensive and aggressive anticorruption campaigns. These campaigns, which targeted officials at all levels of government and the military, went well beyond the scope of efforts undertaken during Jiang's tenure. Xi's historical resolution—a significant political document—implicitly criticizes problems that remained unresolved during Jiang Zemin's governance, though it carefully avoids naming Jiang directly. This indirect criticism suggests Xi's view that his predecessor left behind systemic issues that required addressing.\n\nThe two leaders have also been compared in terms of their personal attributes and political trajectories. Regarding age and tenure, Xi Jinping has been compared to Jiang Zemin in discussions about potential retirement timing. However, in terms of personal cultivation and international sophistication, some observers have drawn unfavorable comparisons between Xi and Jiang Zemin, noting that Jiang was considered more cultured and possessed the ability to speak several languages, suggesting a different style of leadership and international engagement.\n\nThe relationship between Xi Jinping and Jiang Zemin ultimately reflects a broader pattern in Chinese politics where incoming leaders must navigate the continued influence of their predecessors while establishing their own authority.
