As a non-claimant nation, Singapore does not assert sovereignty over any of the disputed territories in the South China Sea, yet it has consistently emphasized the importance of adherence to international law in resolving the complex maritime disputes in the region.\n\nSingapore has been vocal about insisting on compliance with international law as the framework for addressing South China Sea disputes. This position reflects the country's broader foreign policy approach of supporting a rules-based international order, particularly given its strategic location as a major maritime hub in Southeast Asia. The South China Sea represents one of the world's most important shipping lanes, and Singapore has a vested interest in ensuring freedom of navigation and the peaceful resolution of disputes in these waters.\n\nFurthermore, Singapore has actively engaged with arbitration issues related to the South China Sea. This involvement demonstrates the nation's commitment to international legal mechanisms as appropriate tools for dispute resolution. By raising arbitration issues, Singapore has positioned itself as a supporter of peaceful, legal approaches to resolving the territorial and maritime disputes that involve several of its ASEAN neighbors, including the Philippines, Vietnam, Malaysia, and Brunei, as well as major powers such as China.\n\nSingapore's approach reflects a delicate balancing act in regional diplomacy. While maintaining strong economic ties with China and other claimant states, Singapore has consistently advocated for the application of international law, including the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), as the basis for managing and resolving South China Sea disputes. This stance allows Singapore to protect its national interests in maritime security and freedom of navigation while avoiding taking sides in the territorial disputes themselves.\n\nThe South China Sea remains a critical area for Singapore's economic prosperity and regional stability, making the country's engagement on legal and arbitration matters a strategic priority.
