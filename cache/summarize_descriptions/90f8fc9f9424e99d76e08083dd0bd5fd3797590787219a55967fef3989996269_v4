This includes issuing statements on sensitive geopolitical matters, such as those regarding the South China Sea arbitration, demonstrating its role in articulating China's positions on territorial and international legal disputes.\n\nAmong its key functions, the Ministry has been involved in preserving and promoting China's diplomatic heritage. It co-edited selected works of Zhou Enlai on diplomacy, contributing to the documentation and dissemination of important historical diplomatic perspectives from one of China's most prominent statesmen.\n\nThe Ministry also serves as a platform for high-level diplomatic communications and commemorations. It has published significant speeches by Chinese leadership, including Xi Jinping's speech commemorating the 50th anniversary of China-France diplomatic relations, highlighting its role in marking important bilateral relationships and milestones.\n\nThe organization employs official spokespersons who serve as the public face of China's foreign policy.
