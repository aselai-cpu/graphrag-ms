The Trump Administration initiated and subsequently widened what began as a trade war with China, expanding it into a broader technological struggle. This escalation reflected growing concerns about China's technological advancement, intellectual property practices, and the strategic implications of Chinese technology companies' global influence. The conflict extended beyond traditional tariff disputes to encompass restrictions on technology transfers, telecommunications infrastructure, and access to critical technologies.\n\nThe deterioration in relations also affected media and diplomatic personnel. The Trump Administration took the controversial step of forcing Chinese state media employees out of the United States. This action was part of a broader effort to address what the administration viewed as Chinese propaganda operations on American soil. However, this move prompted retaliatory measures from China, which responded by taking action against American reporters working in China, further straining bilateral relations and limiting press freedom in both countries.\n\nThese actions collectively represented a fundamental recalibration of U.S.-China relations, moving away from the engagement-focused approach of previous administrations toward a more confrontational stance based on strategic competition.
