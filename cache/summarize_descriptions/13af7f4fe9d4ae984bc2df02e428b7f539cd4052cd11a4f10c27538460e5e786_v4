This crucial governing institution has been chaired by several of China's most prominent leaders throughout its history and plays a central role in the Chinese political system.\n\nHistorically, the CMC was chaired by Mao Zedong starting in 1936, establishing its importance as a key leadership position. Later, Deng Xiaoping chaired the commission during his time as paramount leader, serving until 1989. Notably, the CMC chairmanship was the last leadership post held by Deng Xiaoping before he stepped down from power, underscoring its significance in the Chinese leadership hierarchy. Geng Biao also served in the CMC as secretary-general during this period.\n\nCurrently, Xi Jinping serves as chairman of the Central Military Commission, a position to which he was elected in March 2018. The CMC's membership is decided by the Central Committee, with Xi holding the chairman position. Under Xi's leadership, the commission has undergone significant structural changes and reforms.\n\nOne of the most notable transformations under Xi has been the shrinking of the CMC from eleven members to seven, representing a substantial consolidation of military leadership. This restructuring has been accompanied by a centralization of decision-making authority under the \"CMC chairman responsibility system,\" which concentrates power in the hands of the chairman and streamlines the command structure of China's military forces.\n\nThe commission has also been affected by high-level corruption cases. Two former vice chairmen of the CMC were dismissed for corruption, highlighting Xi Jinping's broader anti-corruption campaign that has targeted senior military officials. These dismissals represent significant upheaval within China's military leadership and demonstrate the challenges of maintaining discipline within the armed forces hierarchy.\n\nAs the council that commands China's armed forces, the Central Military Commission serves as the critical link between the Chinese Communist Party and the People's Liberation Army. Its chairman holds one of the most powerful positions in China's political system, with direct control over military affairs and national defense policy. The commission's decisions and composition reflect broader trends in Chinese politics, including the concentration of power, efforts to combat corruption, and the modernization of military command structures.\n\nThe CMC's evolution from Mao's era through Deng's reforms to Xi's current leadership demonstrates its enduring importance as a pillar of Chinese governance and its role in maintaining party control over the military.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"citations": null, "thinking_blocks": null}}}], "created": 1769998159, "model": "claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 539, "prompt_tokens": 460, "total_tokens": 999, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": null, "audio_tokens": null, "reasoning_tokens": null, "rejected_prediction_tokens": null, "text_tokens": 539}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null, "cache_creation_tokens": 0, "cache_creation_token_details": {"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens": 0, "ephemeral_1h_input_tokens": 0}}, "cache_creation_input_tokens": 0, "cache_read_input_tokens": 0}, "formatted_response": null, "content": "# Central Military Commission - Comprehensive Summary\n\nThe Central Military Commission (CMC) is China's supreme military leadership body and the party organization that commands China's armed forces.
