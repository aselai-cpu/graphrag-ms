His diplomatic career has been marked by steady advancement through key roles in China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs.\n\nThroughout his career, Qin Gang served in multiple important capacities, including as protocol chief and vice foreign minister beginning in 2018. His expertise and diplomatic acumen caught the attention of Chinese President Xi Jinping, who personally handpicked him to serve as China's envoy to Washington, D.C., representing the People's Republic of China in one of its most critical bilateral relationships.\n\nQin Gang's diplomatic style has been characterized as that of a \"nuanced wolf warrior,\" a term that reflects the assertive and nationalistic approach to diplomacy that has become increasingly common among Chinese officials in recent years. However, the \"nuanced\" qualifier suggests that Qin Gang employed this approach with more sophistication and subtlety than some of his contemporaries, balancing firmness in defending Chinese interests with diplomatic finesse.\n\nAs Vice Foreign Minister, Qin Gang demonstrated China's assertive diplomatic stance during the COVID-19 pandemic. Notably, he intervened in Italy's aviation policy decisions, requiring Italy to suspend its decision to cancel direct flights between Italy and China. This action exemplified China's proactive approach to maintaining international connections and protecting its interests during a period of global disruption and travel restrictions.\n\nHis selection by Xi Jinping as ambassador to the United States underscored his importance within China's diplomatic hierarchy and reflected the Chinese leadership's confidence in his ability to navigate the complex and often contentious relationship between the world's two largest economies.
