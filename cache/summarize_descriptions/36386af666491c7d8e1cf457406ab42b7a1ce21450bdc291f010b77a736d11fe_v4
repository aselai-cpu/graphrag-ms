He is best known for his strong advocacy of market-oriented economic policies and his belief in limiting government intervention in the economy.\n\nAs a leading voice in Chinese economic discourse, Zhang Weiying has been a vocal proponent of free-market principles, arguing that the government should adopt a hands-off approach to economic management. His economic philosophy centers on the idea that the government's role should be strictly limited to fostering open, equal, and competitive markets, rather than directly intervening in economic activities.\n\nZhang Weiying gained significant attention for his public debate with fellow economist Lin Yifu regarding the appropriate extent of government involvement in China's economy. This debate highlighted fundamental disagreements within Chinese economic circles about the optimal balance between state control and market forces. While Lin Yifu has generally supported a more active role for government in guiding economic development, Zhang Weiying has consistently advocated for minimal government interference, positioning himself as a champion of market liberalization.\n\nDespite his prominence as an economist and public intellectual, Zhang Weiying has faced challenges in disseminating his ideas. He has experienced increasing difficulty in getting his writings published, suggesting that his free-market views may have encountered resistance or censorship within China's evolving political and intellectual climate. This restriction on his ability to publish reflects broader tensions in contemporary China between market-oriented reformers and those favoring greater state control over the economy.\n\nZhang Weiying's contributions to economic thought in China represent an important perspective in ongoing debates about the country's economic future and the appropriate relationship between government and markets in a socialist market economy.
