During this initial encounter with America, Xi Jinping showed a notable affinity for American culture, suggesting an openness and curiosity about the Western nation during his earlier years.\n\nFollowing Deng Xiaoping's influential southern tour, which marked a pivotal moment in China's economic reform and opening-up policy, Xi Jinping traveled to the United States with the specific purpose of soliciting investments and establishing commercial tie-ups. This visit reflected China's broader strategy of engaging with international markets and attracting foreign capital to fuel its economic development.\n\nThroughout his career, Xi Jinping made multiple visits to the United States and actively engaged in foreign policy matters with the country. One significant visit occurred in 2015, during which he met with both American and Chinese executives, including prominent business leader Ma, demonstrating the importance of economic and business relations in the bilateral relationship between the two nations.\n\nAs Xi Jinping ascended to power in China, his demeanor and approach underwent a notable transformation. While he had initially displayed warmth toward American culture, he toughened his stance as he assumed leadership positions. This shift reflected both his evolving political position and the changing dynamics of U.S.-China relations.\n\nIn terms of diplomatic philosophy, Xi Jinping championed a new model of major-power relations with the United States. This framework was based on principles of mutual respect and nonconfrontation, representing his vision for how the world's two largest economies should manage their complex relationship. This proposed model sought to establish a foundation for stable and constructive engagement between the two powers, acknowledging their significant global influence while attempting to minimize potential conflicts.\n\nXi Jinping's engagement with the United States thus represents a multifaceted relationship that has evolved over time, from his early cultural exposure and economic missions to his later diplomatic initiatives as China's leader. His interactions with the U.S. reflect both the opportunities for cooperation and the challenges inherent in managing relations between two major global powers with different political systems and strategic interests.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"citations": null, "thinking_blocks": null}}}], "created": 1769998561, "model": "claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 463, "prompt_tokens": 311, "total_tokens": 774, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": null, "audio_tokens": null, "reasoning_tokens": null, "rejected_prediction_tokens": null, "text_tokens": 463}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null, "cache_creation_tokens": 0, "cache_creation_token_details": {"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens": 0, "ephemeral_1h_input_tokens": 0}}, "cache_creation_input_tokens": 0, "cache_read_input_tokens": 0}, "formatted_response": null, "content": "# Comprehensive Summary: Xi Jinping and the United States\n\nXi Jinping's relationship with the United States spans several decades, beginning with his first visit to the country in 1985.
