The organization's operations and distribution activities are fundamentally governed by U.S. legal frameworks regarding intellectual property and copyright protection.\n\nThe primary mission of Project Gutenberg centers on the distribution of literary works that have entered the public domain in the United States. Public domain status means these works are no longer protected by copyright restrictions within U.S. territory, allowing Project Gutenberg to legally digitize, archive, and distribute them freely to the public. The organization's ability to offer these works depends entirely on their public domain status as determined by United States copyright law.\n\nProject Gutenberg's operational framework is intrinsically tied to the United States legal system, which defines the parameters within which the organization can function.
