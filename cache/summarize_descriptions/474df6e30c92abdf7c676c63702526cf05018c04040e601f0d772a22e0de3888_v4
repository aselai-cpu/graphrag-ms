During his formative years, particularly during his time in Liangjiahe, Xi read Mao's works on revolutionary strategy, absorbing the foundational texts that would later inform his political thinking.\n\nDespite this early exposure to Maoist thought, Xi rose to power in the post-Mao era, a period when the Communist Party had deliberately shifted away from Mao's more radical policies and embraced technocratic leadership under Deng Xiaoping's reforms. This timing meant that Xi's political ascent occurred within a system that had already moved beyond pure Maoism, creating a unique position from which he would later navigate between different ideological epochs.\n\nOnce in power, Xi has demonstrated a nuanced approach to Mao's legacy, selectively invoking and reviving certain elements while deliberately avoiding others. He has invoked Mao's revolutionary slogans and revived some Mao-era political practices, drawing on the symbolic power and political legitimacy associated with the founding father of the People's Republic. Xi has also referenced Mao's Cultural Revolution in his governance approach, though the extent and manner of these references reflect careful political calculation rather than wholesale endorsement.\n\nImportantly, Xi is reaching for the national mythos established by Mao and drawing on past progress from Mao's era, using this historical foundation to legitimize his own political agenda and vision for China's future. However, his approach is not one of simple imitation or restoration. Rather, Xi has shunned certain tenets of Maoism, recognizing that a complete return to Maoist ideology would be neither practical nor desirable in contemporary China.\n\nThis selective engagement reflects Xi's broader ideological position, as he has suggested that the party should grasp the continuity between the epochs of Mao and Deng. This formulation allows Xi to present himself as a unifying figure who honors the revolutionary achievements of Mao while maintaining the economic pragmatism and development focus introduced by Deng.
