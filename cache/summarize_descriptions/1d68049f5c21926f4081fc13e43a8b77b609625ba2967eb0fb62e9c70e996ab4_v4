As the governing party, it maintains comprehensive control over the country's political system and narrative.\n\nUnder Xi Jinping's leadership, the party has undergone significant ideological developments. Most notably, at its nineteenth national congress in 2017, the Communist Party rewrote its charter to include \"Xi Jinping Thought,\" elevating Xi's ideological contributions to a status comparable to previous paramount leaders. This addition represents a major shift in the party's official doctrine and Xi's consolidation of power within the organization.\n\nThe party's governance structure includes the Politburo Standing Committee, which serves as its top decision-making body, representing the highest echelon of political power in China. Through this hierarchical structure, party committees are embedded throughout various levels of government and society, where they play a central role in setting policies and ensuring party control.\n\nThe Communist Party of China maintains its power through multiple mechanisms. It exercises strict control over historical narratives and media organizations, determining how the party's past is presented and celebrated through academic work and public discourse. Xi Jinping has emphasized the importance of telling the party's stories well, reflecting the organization's focus on controlling its own narrative and public perception.\n\nIdeologically, the party under Xi's leadership has emphasized celebrating its Marxist roots while simultaneously flexing its coercive powers. The party operates on the principle that while it can retain power through coercion, it must also persuade the population to truly flourish and maintain legitimacy. This dual approach combines traditional Leninist propaganda techniques with modern methods of social control and persuasion.\n\nInterestingly, despite the elevation of Xi Jinping's personal ideology within party doctrine, the Communist Party officially banned personality cults in 1982. This creates a notable tension between the party's formal rules and the practical reality of Xi's prominent position within party ideology and governance.\n\nThe party's approach to governance reflects a combination of ideological commitment, organizational discipline, and pragmatic power maintenance.
