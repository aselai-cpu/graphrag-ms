The city holds significant historical and political importance, particularly in relation to Xi Jinping's early political career.\n\nXi Jinping worked in Fuzhou for twelve years beginning in 1990, where he held prominent leadership positions. He first served as the municipal party boss (Municipal Party Secretary) of Fuzhou, during which time he played a crucial role in shaping the city's development and governance. During his tenure in Fuzhou, Xi Jinping was known for advocating and implementing the \"Do It Right Away\" policy, which emphasized swift and efficient government action and became a hallmark of his administrative approach. Throughout his time in the city, Xi implemented various development projects that contributed to Fuzhou's growth and modernization.\n\nFuzhou is also notable as the location of Fujian People's Publishing House, an important cultural and publishing institution in the region. This publishing house represents the city's role as a center for media and intellectual activity in Fujian province.\n\nThe city has connections to other notable figures as well. Alfred Wu, for instance, worked in Fuzhou as a newspaper reporter during the 2000s, a period when the city was continuing to develop following Xi Jinping's earlier tenure there. Wu's work as a journalist in Fuzhou during this time provided him with firsthand experience of the city's political and social landscape.\n\nFuzhou's significance extends beyond its role as a provincial capital; it represents an important chapter in contemporary Chinese political history, particularly as the place where Xi Jinping developed his administrative philosophy and leadership style before ascending to higher positions in the Chinese government.
