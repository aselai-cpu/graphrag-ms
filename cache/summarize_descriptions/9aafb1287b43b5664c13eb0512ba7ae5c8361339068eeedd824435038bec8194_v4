He played a significant and controversial role in Chinese political history, particularly during periods of intense political persecution.\n\nIn his capacity as security chief under Mao, Kang Sheng was instrumental in orchestrating political campaigns against perceived enemies of the state. One of his most notable actions involved denouncing the novel about Liu Zhidan, a Communist revolutionary hero. Kang Sheng wrote a note to Mao characterizing this novel as a manifesto for Xi Zhongxun and his alleged co-conspirators, effectively framing it as a political conspiracy rather than a literary work. This denunciation had severe consequences for those implicated.\n\nXi Zhongxun, who was a prominent Communist Party official and the father of current Chinese leader Xi Jinping, became one of Kang Sheng's victims. Both Xi Zhongxun and his son Xi Jinping suffered persecution that has been directly attributed to Kang Sheng's actions. The security chief's accusations and political machinations led to their targeting during the tumultuous political campaigns of the Mao era.\n\nKang Sheng's legacy remains deeply controversial in Chinese history. He is remembered as a figure who wielded immense power through his control of security apparatus and his willingness to use that power to persecute political rivals and innocent individuals alike. His role in the suffering of Xi Zhongxun's family is particularly significant given Xi Jinping's later rise to become China's paramount leader, suggesting that the historical memory of Kang Sheng's actions continues to resonate in contemporary Chinese politics.\n\nThe persecution orchestrated by Kang Sheng represents a dark chapter in Chinese Communist Party history, exemplifying how security apparatus could be weaponized for political purposes during the Mao era.
