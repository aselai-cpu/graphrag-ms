The EU launched a WTO case against China over discriminatory trade practices, demonstrating its commitment to enforcing international trade rules and protecting fair competition in global markets. Additionally, the EU took China to the WTO specifically over trade restrictions affecting Lithuania, highlighting the organization's role in defending the interests of its member states.\n\nThese actions reflect the EU's strategic approach to resolving international trade disputes through multilateral institutions rather than unilateral measures. The WTO serves as the formal venue where the EU can challenge what it perceives as violations of international trade agreements and seek remedies for practices it considers discriminatory or unfair. By bringing these cases to the WTO, the EU demonstrates its reliance on rules-based international trade governance and its willingness to confront major trading partners when member state interests are at stake.\n\nThe case involving Lithuania suggests that China may have imposed trade restrictions targeting this specific EU member state, prompting the EU to act collectively in defense of one of its members. This illustrates the EU's solidarity mechanism in trade policy, where challenges faced by individual member states can trigger broader EU-level responses through international legal channels.\n\nBoth cases underscore the ongoing trade tensions between the EU and China, as well as the critical role the WTO plays in mediating disputes between major global economic powers.
