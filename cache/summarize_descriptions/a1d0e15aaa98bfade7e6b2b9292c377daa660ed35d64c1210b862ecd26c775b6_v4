His reporting demonstrates a focus on sensitive geopolitical matters in the Asia-Pacific region.\n\nBlanchard co-authored an exclusive report for Reuters concerning China's seizure of assets from the family of Zhou Yongkang, a high-profile case that garnered international attention. Zhou Yongkang was a former Chinese security chief and member of the Politburo Standing Committee who fell from grace in one of China's most significant anti-corruption cases. The reporting on the asset seizures from Zhou's family members highlighted the far-reaching consequences of China's anti-corruption campaign and provided crucial insights into the Chinese government's actions against formerly powerful political figures.\n\nIn addition to his coverage of Chinese domestic politics, Blanchard has reported on issues of academic freedom and censorship in China. He covered the story of Springer Nature, a major academic publisher, blocking access to certain articles in China. This reporting shed light on the ongoing tensions between international academic publishers and Chinese censorship requirements, illustrating the challenges faced by global organizations operating within China's restrictive information environment.\n\nBlanchard has also demonstrated expertise in defense and military affairs, particularly regarding Taiwan. He has reported on Taiwan's military spending and defense strategy, covering critical aspects of the island's security posture amid ongoing tensions with mainland China. This reporting is particularly significant given Taiwan's geopolitical situation and the increasing military pressure it faces from Beijing, making defense spending and strategic planning crucial topics for understanding regional security dynamics.\n\nThrough his work at Reuters, Ben Blanchard has established himself as a journalist capable of covering complex and politically sensitive topics in Greater China. His reporting spans high-level political corruption cases, censorship and academic freedom issues, and military and defense matters, providing valuable insights into some of the most important developments affecting China, Taiwan, and the broader Asia-Pacific region.
