This permanent membership grants China substantial influence in international affairs and global decision-making processes.\n\nThe relationship between the United Nations and China encompasses both diplomatic cooperation and critical oversight. The United Nations has played a documentary role in China's international agreements, having published the treaty between China and the United Kingdom regarding Hong Kong. This publication reflects the UN's function in maintaining transparency and providing official records of significant international treaties that affect territorial governance and international relations.\n\nHowever, the relationship has also involved serious scrutiny of China's domestic policies. United Nations experts have conducted assessments of China's programs affecting minority populations, concluding that these programs are rife with human rights abuses. This critical evaluation demonstrates the UN's role in monitoring and reporting on human rights conditions globally, even when such assessments involve powerful member states like China. The UN's examination of China's treatment of minorities highlights the organization's commitment to its foundational principles of human rights protection, regardless of a nation's political or economic standing.\n\nThis dynamic illustrates the complex nature of international relations within the United Nations framework, where China simultaneously serves as a key decision-maker in the Security Council while also being subject to human rights scrutiny by UN experts and bodies. The situation reflects the inherent tensions within the international system, where sovereign nations with significant global influence must balance their powerful positions with accountability to international human rights standards and norms.\n\nThe United Nations' engagement with China thus represents both collaborative and adversarial dimensions—cooperation in matters of international governance and treaty documentation, alongside critical assessment of domestic policies that potentially violate international human rights standards.
