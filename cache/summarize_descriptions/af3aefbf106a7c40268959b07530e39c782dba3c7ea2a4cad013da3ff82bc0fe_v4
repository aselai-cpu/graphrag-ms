This territorial dispute has historical roots, dating back to a border war fought between India and China in 1962.\n\nIn recent years, border tensions have escalated dramatically. In June 2020, India was involved in a deadly border clash with Chinese forces at 14,000 feet in the Himalayan region. This lethal brawl was notable for its brutal nature, involving hand-to-hand combat with spiked clubs and fists rather than conventional firearms. The incident represents one of the most serious border skirmishes between the two countries in decades and highlighted the ongoing border crisis between India and China.\n\nBeyond military confrontations, India has also been subject to information warfare and diplomatic tensions with China.
