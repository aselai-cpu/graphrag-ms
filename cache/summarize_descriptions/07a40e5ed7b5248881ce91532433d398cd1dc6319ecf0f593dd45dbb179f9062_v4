He was appointed to the position of Foreign Minister by President Xi Jinping in early 2013.\n\n## Diplomatic Style and Evolution\n\nWang Yi's diplomatic approach has undergone a notable transformation during his tenure. Initially, he was known for his subtlety and flexibility in handling international relations. However, over time, Wang Yi adopted a significantly tougher and more assertive persona in his diplomatic engagements, reflecting broader shifts in China's foreign policy stance.\n\n## Notable Diplomatic Incidents\n\nWang Yi's more confrontational approach has been demonstrated through several high-profile incidents. He notably lambasted Australia over objections related to air defense zone issues, showcasing his willingness to publicly criticize other nations. In another memorable incident, he harshly responded to a Canadian reporter who raised questions about human rights, tearing into the journalist in a manner that drew international attention and exemplified his increasingly aggressive diplomatic style.\n\n## Key Diplomatic Engagements\n\nAs State Councilor, Wang Yi has participated in crucial bilateral meetings with United States officials, including the high-profile talks held in Anchorage. These meetings were significant in the context of U.S.-China relations and demonstrated his central role in managing China's most important diplomatic relationships.\n\nWang Yi has also been vocal on territorial disputes, particularly regarding the South China Sea. He made official remarks concerning the South China Sea arbitration award, representing China's position on this contentious regional issue that involves multiple nations and has significant implications for international maritime law and regional stability.\n\n## Significance in Chinese Diplomacy\n\nWang Yi's role as both Foreign Minister and State Councilor positions him as one of the most influential figures in Chinese foreign policy. His evolution from a subtle and flexible diplomat to a more assertive representative mirrors China's broader shift toward a more confident and sometimes confrontational approach to international relations under Xi Jinping's leadership. His actions and statements have made him a defining figure in contemporary Chinese diplomacy, embodying the country's increasingly assertive stance on the global stage.\n\nThe references to Wang Yi in diplomatic literature and policy discussions (including page references 222-23 in relevant texts) underscore his significance as a subject of study and analysis in understanding modern Chinese foreign policy and diplomatic strategy.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"citations": null, "thinking_blocks": null}}}], "created": 1769998361, "model": "claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 514, "prompt_tokens": 295, "total_tokens": 809, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": null, "audio_tokens": null, "reasoning_tokens": null, "rejected_prediction_tokens": null, "text_tokens": 514}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null, "cache_creation_tokens": 0, "cache_creation_token_details": {"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens": 0, "ephemeral_1h_input_tokens": 0}}, "cache_creation_input_tokens": 0, "cache_read_input_tokens": 0}, "formatted_response": null, "content": "# Wang Yi: Comprehensive Summary\n\nWang Yi is a prominent Chinese diplomat who serves as China's Foreign Minister and State Councilor, representing what has been described as the new face of Chinese diplomacy.
