In 2013, he warned China about its crackdown on foreign press, signaling early concerns about freedom of expression and media independence within the country. This criticism reflected broader American concerns about human rights and civil liberties in China. Additionally, according to reporting, Biden froze out China's Ambassador, a significant diplomatic move that underscored tensions in the bilateral relationship and represented a departure from traditional diplomatic engagement protocols.\n\n## Taiwan Policy and Strategic Ambiguity\n\nA central component of Biden's China policy has focused on Taiwan, one of the most sensitive issues in U.S.-China relations. Biden's policy specifically addresses China's threats to Taiwan, acknowledging the growing military and political pressure that Beijing has exerted on the island democracy. His approach to Taiwan has been notable for maintaining what some analysts describe as \"strategic ambiguity\" – Biden's statements about defending Taiwan have kept Beijing guessing about U.S. intentions regarding whether America would intervene militarily in the event of a Chinese attack on Taiwan. This calculated ambiguity serves multiple purposes: it potentially deters Chinese aggression while avoiding explicit commitments that could either embolden Taiwan toward formal independence or trigger a preemptive Chinese military response.\n\n## Overall Approach\n\nBiden's handling of China reflects a multifaceted strategy that combines diplomatic pressure on human rights issues, direct engagement on matters of press freedom, and careful calibration of messaging on the most sensitive geopolitical flashpoint in the relationship – Taiwan. His willingness to freeze out diplomatic channels when necessary demonstrates a readiness to use traditional diplomatic tools as leverage, while his statements on Taiwan show an understanding of the delicate balance required to maintain stability in the region while supporting democratic allies. This approach suggests Biden views the U.S.-China relationship through both an ideological lens, emphasizing values like press freedom, and a strategic lens, focusing on maintaining regional security and deterring Chinese expansionism.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"citations": null, "thinking_blocks": null}}}], "created": 1769998719, "model": "claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 470, "prompt_tokens": 221, "total_tokens": 691, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": null, "audio_tokens": null, "reasoning_tokens": null, "rejected_prediction_tokens": null, "text_tokens": 470}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null, "cache_creation_tokens": 0, "cache_creation_token_details": {"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens": 0, "ephemeral_1h_input_tokens": 0}}, "cache_creation_input_tokens": 0, "cache_read_input_tokens": 0}, "formatted_response": null, "content": "# Comprehensive Summary: Biden and China\n\nJoe Biden's relationship with China has been characterized by a complex mix of diplomatic pressure, strategic ambiguity, and direct confrontation across multiple dimensions of U.S.-China relations.\n\n## Diplomatic Relations and Press Freedom\n\nBiden has demonstrated a willingness to take strong stances against Chinese government actions.
