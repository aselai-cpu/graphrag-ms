Historically, Japan received Taiwan from the Qing empire and subsequently ruled the island as a colony for five decades, a period that lasted until the end of World War II. This colonial period, which began in 1895 following the First Sino-Japanese War and concluded in 1945, represents a significant chapter in both nations' histories.\n\nIn the present day, the relationship between Japan and Taiwan has transformed considerably from its colonial past. Japan has called for more security cooperation with Taiwan, primarily as a strategic measure to deter China. This call for enhanced security collaboration reflects the changing security dynamics in the East Asian region, where concerns about Chinese military activities and territorial ambitions have grown. Japan's interest in strengthening ties with Taiwan demonstrates the island's strategic importance in regional security architecture, particularly given Taiwan's geographic position and the ongoing tensions across the Taiwan Strait.\n\nThe evolution from colonial ruler to security partner illustrates how historical relationships can be reframed in response to contemporary geopolitical challenges.
