In life, Marley and Scrooge were partners in their counting-house, where their relationship was centered around business and money-changing activities.\n\nAs a living person, Marley's spirit never walked beyond the confines of the counting-house, and he remained focused on financial matters rather than on mankind and humanitarian concerns. This narrow focus on wealth accumulation rather than human compassion would later become the source of his eternal punishment.\n\nMarley died and was buried, becoming a significant figure in Scrooge's past. Upon the point of death, Marley made predictions to Scrooge about the appearance of spirits. After his death, Marley's spirit was condemned to wear heavy chains that he had forged during his lifetime—chains that symbolize the consequences of his earthly choices and his neglect of human kindness in favor of monetary pursuits. As a ghost, Marley is doomed to travel on the wings of the wind, restlessly wandering as punishment for his life's priorities.\n\nMarley's ghost plays a crucial interventional role in Scrooge's transformation. He appears to Scrooge as a supernatural visitor, entering through a door to deliver an important warning. His ghostly appearance serves as the catalyst that sends additional spirits to visit Scrooge, setting in motion the events that would ultimately lead to Scrooge's redemption. Marley comes specifically to warn and trouble Scrooge, attempting to save his former partner from suffering the same fate that he himself endures in the afterlife.\n\nScrooge references Marley multiple times in his reflections, particularly when contemplating past choices and their consequences. The ghost of Jacob Marley makes such a profound impact on Scrooge that Scrooge later addresses him in gratitude and includes him in prayers of thanks, recognizing the importance of Marley's warning and intervention.\n\nThrough his ghostly appearance and warning, Jacob Marley serves as both a cautionary figure and an unlikely savior to Scrooge, demonstrating that even in death, he retained enough concern for his former partner to attempt to spare him from eternal suffering.
