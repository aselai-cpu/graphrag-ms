The Party officially claims Taiwan as a province of China and has made the reunification of Taiwan with mainland China a central component of its national unity efforts and broader political agenda.\n\nFrom an ideological perspective, the Communist Party declares Taiwan to be sacred territory that must be recovered, framing its reunification as essential to restoring China's national dignity. This characterization elevates the Taiwan issue beyond mere territorial claims to a matter of historical justice and national pride, making it a core element of the Party's legitimacy and nationalist narrative.\n\nThe Communist Party's approach to Taiwan encompasses both diplomatic and potentially military dimensions. On one hand, the Party has pursued a peaceful unification strategy, seeking to bring Taiwan under its control through non-military means such as economic integration, diplomatic pressure, and political engagement. This peaceful approach represents the Party's preferred method of achieving reunification.\n\nHowever, the Communist Party has explicitly refused to rule out the use of force to achieve its objectives regarding Taiwan. The Party has indicated that it may resort to military action to secure its vision of a unified China that includes Taiwan, particularly if peaceful reunification efforts fail or if Taiwan moves toward formal independence. This dual-track approach—emphasizing peaceful means while maintaining the threat of force—characterizes the Party's comprehensive strategy toward the island.\n\nThe Communist Party's policies regarding Taiwan have had significant international implications. The Party has been accused of blocking Taiwan's participation in international organizations, specifically preventing Taiwan from attending World Health Organization (WHO) meetings. This exclusion reflects the Party's broader strategy of diplomatically isolating Taiwan and preventing it from gaining recognition as a separate sovereign entity on the international stage.\n\nIn summary, the Communist Party's stance on Taiwan is characterized by unwavering territorial claims, a combination of peaceful and potentially coercive strategies, and active efforts to prevent Taiwan's international recognition. The issue remains central to the Party's national objectives, intertwining territorial integrity with national dignity and historical mission. The Party's approach balances diplomatic engagement with the implicit threat of military intervention, making the Taiwan question one of the most sensitive and consequential issues in contemporary Chinese politics and cross-strait relations.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"citations": null, "thinking_blocks": null}}}], "created": 1769998687, "model": "claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 478, "prompt_tokens": 256, "total_tokens": 734, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": null, "audio_tokens": null, "reasoning_tokens": null, "rejected_prediction_tokens": null, "text_tokens": 478}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null, "cache_creation_tokens": 0, "cache_creation_token_details": {"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens": 0, "ephemeral_1h_input_tokens": 0}}, "cache_creation_input_tokens": 0, "cache_read_input_tokens": 0}, "formatted_response": null, "content": "# Comprehensive Summary: Communist Party and Taiwan\n\nThe Communist Party maintains a firm and uncompromising position regarding Taiwan, viewing the island as an integral part of Chinese territory.
