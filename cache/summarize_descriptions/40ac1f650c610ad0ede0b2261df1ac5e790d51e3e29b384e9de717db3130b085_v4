This framework was intended to preserve Hong Kong's distinct political, economic, and legal systems while acknowledging Chinese sovereignty over the territory.\n\nDespite its historical importance as an international treaty, the Sino-British Joint Declaration has been the subject of controversy regarding its ongoing validity.
