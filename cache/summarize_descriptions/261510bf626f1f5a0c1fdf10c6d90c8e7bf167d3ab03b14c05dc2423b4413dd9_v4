Under Xi's leadership, the CCDI has evolved beyond its traditional anti-corruption mandate to become an omnipresent tool that enforces loyalty to Xi himself as the paramount leader of the Chinese Communist Party.\n\nXi actively engages with the CCDI leadership, directly addressing senior CCDI officials on matters of cadre performance and party discipline. In these interactions, Xi has specifically ordered CCDI officials to curb formalism—a bureaucratic practice characterized by superficial compliance and empty ritualism that undermines effective governance. This directive reflects Xi's broader concern with ensuring that party cadres demonstrate genuine commitment and effectiveness rather than merely going through the motions of their duties.\n\nThe CCDI serves as Xi's primary vehicle for conducting extensive anti-corruption campaigns throughout the party apparatus. These campaigns have become a hallmark of Xi's tenure, targeting officials at all levels of government and the party hierarchy. Through the CCDI, Xi has pursued both \"tigers\" (high-ranking officials) and \"flies\" (lower-level bureaucrats) in an effort to root out corruption and consolidate his authority.\n\nBeyond anti-corruption efforts, Xi utilizes the CCDI as a comprehensive mechanism for enforcing party discipline across the entire Chinese Communist Party structure. This disciplinary function extends to monitoring ideological conformity, investigating violations of party rules, and ensuring that officials maintain strict adherence to party directives. The CCDI's expanded role under Xi encompasses not just financial corruption but also political loyalty, lifestyle issues, and ideological deviation.\n\nXi's transformation of the CCDI represents a strategic consolidation of power, as the institution now functions as both a deterrent against potential opposition and a means of removing political rivals under the guise of anti-corruption measures. The omnipresent nature of the CCDI under Xi's direction means that party officials at all levels operate under constant scrutiny, creating an atmosphere of accountability that ultimately reinforces Xi's central authority.\n\nThrough his command of the CCDI, Xi has effectively created a governance structure where loyalty to his leadership is paramount, and deviation from party discipline carries severe consequences.
