This represented a dramatic shift from the isolationist policies of the Mao era and became a cornerstone of Deng's reform and opening-up policy (gaige kaifang). Through these initiatives, Deng facilitated increased foreign investment, technology transfer, and commercial partnerships between China and Western nations, which ultimately transformed China into a major player in the global economy.\n\nHowever, Deng Xiaoping's openness to the West was strictly limited to economic and technological domains. He drew a clear and firm line when it came to political systems and governance structures. In conversations with a Yugoslav leader, Deng explicitly stated that China's reforms could not and would not borrow from Western democracy or the Western concept of separation of powers. This position reflected his commitment to maintaining the Chinese Communist Party's monopoly on political power while simultaneously modernizing the country's economic infrastructure.\n\nThis dual approach—economic liberalization coupled with political conservatism—became the defining characteristic of Deng Xiaoping's relationship with the West. He sought to harness Western capital, technology, and market access to fuel China's development, while simultaneously resisting Western political influence and maintaining China's socialist political system under single-party rule. This strategy allowed China to benefit from engagement with Western economies without compromising the Communist Party's authority or adopting Western-style democratic institutions.\n\nDeng's selective engagement with the West established a framework that has largely persisted in Chinese policy to the present day, demonstrating his lasting influence on China's approach to international relations and domestic governance.
