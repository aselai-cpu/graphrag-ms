He gained attention for his engagement on social media, specifically Twitter, where he posted sarcastic remarks about pro-Beijing trolls. This online activity led to an unusual diplomatic exchange that escalated when the Chinese embassy publicly responded to his tweets.\n\nIn what became a significant moment highlighting tensions in France-China relations, the Chinese embassy called Bondaz a \"petite frappe,\" which translates to \"little rascal\" or \"small-time thug\" in English. This derogatory term, used by an official diplomatic mission against an individual researcher, was considered highly unusual and unprofessional in diplomatic circles. The incident exemplifies the increasingly confrontational approach that some Chinese diplomatic missions have adopted in their public communications, sometimes referred to as \"wolf warrior diplomacy.\"\n\nThe Twitter exchange between Bondaz and the Chinese embassy represents a broader pattern of diplomatic tensions and highlights how social media has become a new battleground for international relations and public diplomacy. Bondaz's willingness to engage critically with pro-Beijing narratives and the subsequent response from official Chinese diplomatic channels illustrates the challenges faced by researchers and commentators who analyze or critique Chinese policies.\n\nThis incident brought Bondaz into the public spotlight as an individual who was willing to stand by his critical commentary despite facing direct pushback from an official state embassy.
