Deng succeeded in becoming the dominant figure in Chinese politics, though he had to navigate the immediate aftermath of Mao's passing and depose Mao's designated successor to consolidate his position.\n\nOnce in power, Deng Xiaoping fundamentally reoriented the Chinese Communist Party's approach and reversed many of Mao Zedong's policies. He systematically worked to pull China away from Mao's radicalism and stamp out the vestiges of Maoism that had characterized the previous era. Deng's policies represented a dramatic departure from Maoist ideology, as he ditched Mao's utopian ideals in favor of more pragmatic economic and political reforms.\n\nHowever, despite this significant policy reversal, Deng Xiaoping maintained continuity with certain aspects of Mao's legacy. Notably, he clung to Mao's narrative of national redemption, preserving this foundational element of Chinese Communist Party ideology even while transforming the practical mechanisms through which China would pursue its goals.\n\nThe relationship between Deng Xiaoping's policies and Maoism became a subject of significant discussion and analysis, as observers sought to understand how Deng managed to transform China while maintaining the legitimacy of the Communist Party that Mao had built. This delicate balance—rejecting Maoist radicalism while preserving core nationalist narratives—became a defining characteristic of Deng's leadership approach.\n\nIn summary, Deng Xiaoping's succession of Mao Zedong marked a critical turning point in Chinese history. While Mao's death in 1976 ended an era of revolutionary radicalism and utopian experimentation, Deng's subsequent leadership initiated a period of pragmatic reform and economic modernization.
