Founded in 1949 with a militaristic ethos, the organization initially operated with what has been described as gladiatorial instincts. However, it shed these more aggressive characteristics during the post-Mao years as China's diplomatic approach evolved.\n\nUnder President Xi Jinping's leadership, the ministry has experienced a significant transformation in its operational mandate and tone. Xi has urged the organization to \"strive and accomplish things\" and to vigorously enforce Communist Party narratives in its diplomatic engagements. This represents a return to a more assertive posture in China's foreign relations, marking a departure from the more restrained approach of the post-Mao era.\n\nThe ministry plays a central role in shaping and defending China's international image across multiple fronts. It has been actively involved in managing China's Covid-19 response messaging, working to control the narrative around the pandemic on the global stage. The organization has also taken a proactive stance in countering what it perceives as Western narratives, particularly regarding sensitive issues such as Xinjiang. To this end, the ministry has convened meetings with expert advisers to develop strategies for pushing back against international criticism and alternative accounts of events in the region.\n\nThe Chinese Foreign Ministry has demonstrated a willingness to use diplomatic pressure to influence foreign media coverage. In one notable instance, the organization summoned the Wall Street Journal bureau chief and threatened serious consequences over a story involving Ming Chai. In another case, the ministry complained directly to the Wall Street Journal bureau chief about reports concerning Xi Jinping's health, characterizing such reporting as irresponsible. These actions illustrate the ministry's aggressive approach to managing China's image in international media.\n\nOn regional diplomatic matters, the ministry has been vocal in defending China's positions. It echoed statements from the Global Times, accusing individual countries of attempting to insert South China Sea-related content into international communiqués, demonstrating its role in protecting China's territorial claims and regional interests.\n\nThe ministry has also served as a platform for prominent spokespersons who embody its more assertive diplomatic style. Zhao Lijian, known for his confrontational approach, was appointed as an official spokesperson for the organization, reflecting the ministry's evolution toward what observers have termed \"wolf warrior diplomacy\" – a more combative and nationalistic approach to international relations that aligns with Xi Jinping's directive for the ministry to more forcefully advance and defend Communist Party narratives on the world stage.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"citations": null, "thinking_blocks": null}}}], "created": 1769998305, "model": "claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 554, "prompt_tokens": 371, "total_tokens": 925, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": null, "audio_tokens": null, "reasoning_tokens": null, "rejected_prediction_tokens": null, "text_tokens": 554}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null, "cache_creation_tokens": 0, "cache_creation_token_details": {"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens": 0, "ephemeral_1h_input_tokens": 0}}, "cache_creation_input_tokens": 0, "cache_read_input_tokens": 0}, "formatted_response": null, "content": "# CHINESE FOREIGN MINISTRY - Comprehensive Summary\n\nThe Chinese Foreign Ministry is the government department responsible for China's diplomatic relations and foreign affairs.
