This promotion serves multiple interconnected purposes in Xi's governance approach.\n\nXi celebrated Confucius with the explicit aim of inspiring virtue among officials while simultaneously using Confucian principles to justify authoritarian rule. By invoking the ancient philosopher's teachings, Xi seeks to establish a moral framework for government officials that draws on traditional Chinese values and ethical standards. This appeal to Confucian virtue serves as a tool for legitimizing centralized authority and hierarchical governance structures that are characteristic of both classical Confucian political philosophy and Xi's contemporary leadership style.\n\nBeyond the immediate goal of shaping official conduct, Xi has promoted Confucius and other classical Chinese thinkers as part of a broader cultural initiative designed to instill pride in Chinese civilization. This cultural revival represents an effort to strengthen national identity and confidence by reconnecting contemporary China with its rich philosophical heritage. By elevating Confucius and traditional Chinese thought, Xi positions China's cultural legacy as a source of strength and distinctiveness on the global stage.\n\nThe dual nature of Xi's promotion of Confucius—both as a means of governance and as a source of cultural pride—reflects a comprehensive strategy that intertwines political control with cultural nationalism.
