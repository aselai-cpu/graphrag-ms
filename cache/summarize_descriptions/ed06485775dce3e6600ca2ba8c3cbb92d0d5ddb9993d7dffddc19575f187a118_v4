This crisis, which involved heightened tensions between Taiwan and mainland China, prompted one of the most significant U.S. military responses in the Asia-Pacific region during the post-Cold War era. The deployment of naval assets, including aircraft carrier battle groups, served as a clear demonstration of American resolve to maintain stability in the Taiwan Strait and to deter potential military aggression against Taiwan. This military intervention underscored the strategic importance of Taiwan to U.S. interests in the Indo-Pacific region and highlighted America's willingness to project power in defense of the island.\n\nBeyond military support, the U.S. has also maintained diplomatic engagement with Taiwan despite the complex international political environment surrounding Taiwan's status. This diplomatic relationship was notably demonstrated when the U.S. sent its Health Secretary to Taiwan, a visit that carried significant symbolic weight. High-level visits by U.S. cabinet officials to Taiwan are relatively rare and politically sensitive given the U.S.'s official \"One China\" policy, which acknowledges Beijing's position that Taiwan is part of China while maintaining unofficial relations with Taipei. The Health Secretary's visit represented a tangible expression of the ongoing U.S.-Taiwan relationship and America's commitment to engaging with Taiwan on matters of mutual interest, including public health cooperation.\n\nTogether, these actions illustrate the multifaceted nature of U.S.-Taiwan relations, which encompasses both security cooperation and diplomatic engagement. The U.S. has consistently balanced its complex relationship with both Taiwan and mainland China, providing Taiwan with defensive support while managing broader regional dynamics. The military deployment during the 1995-1996 crisis and the subsequent high-level diplomatic visits demonstrate that the U.S. maintains a policy of supporting Taiwan through both hard power deterrence and soft power diplomacy, reflecting Taiwan's continued importance to American strategic interests in the Asia-Pacific region.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"citations": null, "thinking_blocks": null}}}], "created": 1769998704, "model": "claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 472, "prompt_tokens": 204, "total_tokens": 676, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": null, "audio_tokens": null, "reasoning_tokens": null, "rejected_prediction_tokens": null, "text_tokens": 472}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null, "cache_creation_tokens": 0, "cache_creation_token_details": {"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens": 0, "ephemeral_1h_input_tokens": 0}}, "cache_creation_input_tokens": 0, "cache_read_input_tokens": 0}, "formatted_response": null, "content": "# Comprehensive Summary: U.S.-Taiwan Relations\n\nThe United States has demonstrated a sustained commitment to Taiwan's security and has maintained significant diplomatic engagement with the island nation across multiple decades, as evidenced by key historical actions.\n\nDuring the 1995-1996 Taiwan Strait Crisis, the U.S. took decisive military action to protect Taiwan by deploying warships and aircraft carriers to the region.
