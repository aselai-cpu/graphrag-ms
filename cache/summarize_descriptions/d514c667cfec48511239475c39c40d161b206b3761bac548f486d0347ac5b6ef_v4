He assumed the role of party chief following Deng's death and governed China during a transformative period in the nation's modern history, stepping down from his position as general secretary in 2002.\n\nDuring his tenure leading China, Jiang Zemin implemented several significant policy initiatives and doctrines that shaped the country's development trajectory. Most notably, he declared that China aimed to build a socialist market economy, representing a crucial evolution in the nation's economic system that sought to blend socialist principles with market mechanisms. This declaration marked a continuation and expansion of the economic reforms initiated under his predecessor.\n\nJiang Zemin introduced two major doctrines that became defining features of his leadership. First, he established the concept of \"yifa zhiguo,\" which emphasized rule by law and governance according to legal principles. As part of this initiative, he enacted new statutes designed to fill gaps in China's legislation, working to create a more comprehensive legal framework for the country. Second, he introduced the influential \"Three Represents\" doctrine, which expanded the ideological foundation of the Chinese Communist Party and became a cornerstone of his political legacy.\n\nA key focus of Jiang Zemin's leadership was integrating China with the international order. He worked to position China as an increasingly active participant in global affairs and international institutions, moving the country toward greater engagement with the world economy and international community. This outward-looking approach represented a significant shift in China's foreign policy orientation and helped facilitate the country's rise as a major global power.\n\nJiang Zemin's leadership period was characterized by efforts to modernize China's governance structures, strengthen its legal system, reform its economy, and enhance its international standing. His policies and doctrines had lasting impacts on China's development path, influencing the country's trajectory well beyond his time in office.
