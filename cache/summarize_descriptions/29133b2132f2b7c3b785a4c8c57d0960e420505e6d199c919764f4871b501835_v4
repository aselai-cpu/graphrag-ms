This region is distinguished by several notable features related to censorship, education, and border controls.\n\nIn terms of internet governance, Mainland China operates the Great Firewall, a sophisticated system of technological restrictions that limits and controls internet access for its population. This infrastructure represents one of the most comprehensive internet censorship systems in the world, blocking access to various foreign websites and monitoring online communications.\n\nAcademically, Mainland China has shown selective engagement with sensitive historical topics. Notably, Fudan University held the distinction of being the only university in Mainland China offering courses on the Cultural Revolution, highlighting the general reluctance or restriction within the Chinese higher education system to openly examine this controversial period of Chinese history.\n\nThe region also maintains strict controls over media and press freedom. This is evidenced by the case of an author who was expelled from Mainland China after being denied press credential renewal, demonstrating the government's willingness to remove foreign journalists and writers whose work may be deemed problematic or contrary to official narratives.\n\nBorder controls between Mainland China and Hong Kong have been tightened, particularly concerning the movement of printed materials. Sensitive books from Hong Kong have been prevented from entering Mainland China due to enhanced border checks, reflecting the government's efforts to control the flow of information and ideas that might challenge official positions or introduce alternative perspectives to mainland readers. This measure underscores the broader pattern of information control that extends beyond digital censorship to include physical media.\n\nThese various aspects of control—over internet access, academic curriculum, press freedom, and cross-border information flow—collectively illustrate Mainland China's comprehensive approach to managing information and maintaining ideological control within its territory.
