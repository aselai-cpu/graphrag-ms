The two nations maintain strong economic ties, with China serving as South Korea's largest trading partner. In fact, South Korea's trade volume with China exceeds its combined trade with both the United States and Japan, underscoring the critical importance of the Chinese market to the South Korean economy.\n\nDespite this robust economic partnership, the relationship has been tested by security considerations and geopolitical tensions. A notable example of this friction occurred in 2017 when South Korea decided to deploy the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) system, a U.S. missile defense system intended to protect against North Korean threats. China strongly opposed this deployment, viewing it as a threat to its own security interests and regional strategic balance.\n\nIn response to the THAAD deployment, China engaged in what has been characterized as economic warfare against South Korea. This retaliation included informal boycotts of South Korean products, restrictions on Chinese tourism to South Korea, and targeting of South Korean businesses operating in China, particularly in the entertainment and retail sectors. These measures inflicted significant economic damage on South Korean companies and demonstrated China's willingness to leverage its economic influence as a tool of political pressure.\n\nThis episode highlights the delicate balancing act that South Korea must perform in its foreign relations. On one hand, the country relies heavily on China for economic prosperity and growth. On the other hand, South Korea must manage legitimate security concerns, including threats from North Korea and its alliance commitments with the United States. The THAAD controversy exemplifies the challenges South Korea faces in navigating between its economic dependence on China and its security alignment with the United States.\n\nThe relationship between South Korea and China continues to be defined by this fundamental tension between economic cooperation and security competition. South Korea must carefully calibrate its policies to maintain beneficial trade relations with China while also addressing its national security needs and maintaining its strategic partnerships. This balancing act remains one of the central challenges in South Korean foreign policy and reflects broader dynamics in the Asia-Pacific region, where economic integration and security rivalries often intersect in complex ways.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"citations": null, "thinking_blocks": null}}}], "created": 1769998751, "model": "claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 466, "prompt_tokens": 210, "total_tokens": 676, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": null, "audio_tokens": null, "reasoning_tokens": null, "rejected_prediction_tokens": null, "text_tokens": 466}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null, "cache_creation_tokens": 0, "cache_creation_token_details": {"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens": 0, "ephemeral_1h_input_tokens": 0}}, "cache_creation_input_tokens": 0, "cache_read_input_tokens": 0}, "formatted_response": null, "content": "# South Korea and China: Complex Economic and Security Relations\n\nSouth Korea and China share a complex bilateral relationship characterized by deep economic interdependence alongside significant security tensions.
