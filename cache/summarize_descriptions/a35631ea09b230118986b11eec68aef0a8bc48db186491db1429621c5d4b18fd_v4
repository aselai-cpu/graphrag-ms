His earliest documented connection dates back to 1989, when he gave an interview to a Hong Kong newspaper discussing his father's role in his career development.\n\nXi Jinping's formal responsibilities over Hong Kong affairs began in 2007, marking the start of a more direct involvement in the city's governance. During his early engagement with the region, he traveled to Hong Kong to solicit investments and establish commercial tie-ups, reflecting the economic dimensions of the mainland-Hong Kong relationship.\n\nA pivotal moment in Xi Jinping's relationship with Hong Kong came in 2017, when he visited the city to mark the 20th anniversary of Hong Kong's return to China (handover from British rule). During this visit, he delivered a speech at the celebration commemorating this milestone. Significantly, he used this occasion to issue a stern warning against challenging central government authority, signaling his administration's expectations for Hong Kong's political alignment with Beijing.\n\nUnder Xi Jinping's leadership, policies affecting Hong Kong's governance have become increasingly interventionist. His vision for Hong Kong is embedded within his broader objective of achieving a unified Chinese nation, which necessitates stronger central control over the semi-autonomous region. This approach represents a shift toward greater Beijing oversight and reduced autonomy for Hong Kong.\n\nXi Jinping's personal involvement in the Hong Kong crisis became particularly evident during the period of widespread protests in the city. His response to these demonstrations was characterized by forceful measures, most notably the imposition of a national security law on Hong Kong. This controversial legislation significantly expanded Beijing's authority over the city and restricted civil liberties that had previously distinguished Hong Kong from mainland China. Complementing this legal framework, Xi's administration orchestrated a comprehensive crackdown that included rounding up opposition figures, effectively dismantling much of the organized pro-democracy movement in the city.\n\nThroughout his tenure, Xi Jinping has demonstrated a consistent pattern of tightening control over Hong Kong, moving from economic engagement to political intervention and ultimately to direct security measures. His policies reflect a determination to integrate Hong Kong more fully into the Chinese political system while eliminating challenges to central authority.
