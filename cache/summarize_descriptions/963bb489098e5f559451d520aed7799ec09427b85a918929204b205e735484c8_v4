Hong Kong protesters have rebuffed Beijing's proposals for electing officials, reflecting deep-seated concerns about the erosion of the city's autonomy and democratic freedoms. These protests demonstrate the resistance among Hong Kong residents to what they perceive as Beijing's increasing interference in the city's political processes and attempts to limit genuine universal suffrage.\n\nIn response to ongoing civil unrest and pro-democracy movements, Beijing imposed a national security law on Hong Kong. This legislation has been controversial both domestically and internationally, as critics argue it undermines the freedoms and autonomy that were promised to Hong Kong under the \"one country, two systems\" arrangement.
