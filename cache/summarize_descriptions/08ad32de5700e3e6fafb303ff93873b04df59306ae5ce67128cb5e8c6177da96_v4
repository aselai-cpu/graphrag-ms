As a key component of the CCP's leadership apparatus, the Politburo plays a central role in shaping party policy, reviewing and approving important documents such as official party histories, and making critical decisions regarding party governance and national direction.\n\nHistorically, the Politburo has been led by the party's most senior leaders, with Mao Zedong becoming chairman of this body in 1943. In the contemporary era, Xi Jinping has chaired Politburo meetings in his capacity as general secretary, where he has pledged to control the party's size and shape its direction. Notably, in May 2021, Xi used a Politburo meeting to call for cultivating a credible, lovable, and respectable image for China on the international stage.\n\nThe Politburo has been instrumental in issuing important party directives, including a 2015 directive that demanded stronger party leadership over businesses and social groups, reflecting the party's expanding influence over various sectors of Chinese society. The body also serves as the broader party organization that encompasses various leadership roles and positions within the CCP hierarchy, including the zhengfawei secretary role, which was downgraded to this level.\n\nMembership in the Politburo represents a significant achievement in a Chinese official's career. Shanghai party secretaries have traditionally been included among its members. Notable figures who have served on the Politburo include Bo Xilai, who secured a seat in 2007 before his eventual purge in 2012; Li Yuanchao, who served as a member; and Yang Jiechi, who joined in 2017, becoming the first diplomat in fifteen years to achieve such a high rank. However, membership can also be revoked, as demonstrated by the dismissal of Chen Liangyu from this senior party body.\n\nThe Politburo has also seen leadership transitions, such as when Meng Jianzhu stepped down from this high-level party organization in 2017, illustrating the regular rotation of officials within China's political system.
