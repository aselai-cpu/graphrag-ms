The publication opened its Beijing bureau in 1979 and has maintained a significant presence across Asia, with bureaus in multiple regions to support its foreign correspondence operations.\n\n## Coverage Focus\n\nThe Wall Street Journal has published comprehensive reporting on numerous aspects of China, including:\n\n**Political Coverage**: The newspaper has extensively reported on Xi Jinping's rise to power, his consolidation of authority, his ability to rule indefinitely (following the 2018 constitutional changes), and his third term as Communist Party leader in October 2022. Coverage has included articles about Xi's strongman rule, his economic policies, speculation about his health and succession concerns, and how the U.S. initially misread him as a globalist when he became an autocrat.\n\n**Human Rights and Surveillance**: The publication has reported extensively on China's surveillance systems, facial recognition technology, DNA databases, health tracking apps, and data collection practices. Significant coverage has been devoted to Xinjiang policies, including the application of policing lessons to other Muslim areas, ethnic assimilation campaigns, and the treatment of Uighur Muslims. The newspaper has also covered Tibet, Inner Mongolia protests, and China's crackdown on dissent.\n\n**Economic and Business Reporting**: The Journal has published numerous articles about China's economy, stock market, state capitalism, regulatory matters, business figures, and corporate issues.
