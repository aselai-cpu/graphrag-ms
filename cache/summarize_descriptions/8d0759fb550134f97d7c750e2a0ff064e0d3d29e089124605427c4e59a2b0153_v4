She joined the revolutionary movement during World War II and worked at an elite party academy, where she was required to live due to her position. Together with Xi Zhongxun, she had four children, including Xi Jinping, who would later become China's paramount leader.\n\nAs an author, Qi Xin wrote commemorative articles and essays about her husband Xi Zhongxun, contributing to anthology collections that honored his memory and legacy. In her writings, she documented aspects of their family life, including her husband's demanding parenting style and the challenges they faced together.\n\nQi Xin's life was profoundly affected by China's tumultuous political periods, particularly during the Cultural Revolution. She endured extremely difficult circumstances during this time, being forced to participate in struggle sessions where she had to shout slogans against her own son, Xi Jinping. In one of the most painful episodes of this period, when Xi Jinping escaped from detention, Qi Xin made the agonizing decision to report him to the authorities herself. This decision was driven by her desperate situation—she feared being detained if she didn't comply, which would have left her other children without any parental care. This incident illustrates the impossible choices that families faced during the Cultural Revolution, where political survival often required betraying one's own loved ones.\n\nQi Xin also witnessed her husband Xi Zhongxun's own political persecution. She recalled being instructed by Zhou Enlai to watch over her husband during his difficult times, and she remembered poignant scenes of him sitting silently in their living room with the lights turned off, reflecting the psychological toll of his political troubles.\n\nLater in life, as Xi Jinping's political career advanced, Qi Xin demonstrated political awareness and caution. Before her son took power as China's leader, she reportedly advised her other children to dial back their business activities to avoid creating problems or the appearance of impropriety that could complicate Xi Jinping's rise to leadership.
