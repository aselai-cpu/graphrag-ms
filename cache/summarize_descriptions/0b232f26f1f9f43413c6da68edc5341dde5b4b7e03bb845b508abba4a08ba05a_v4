Originally the governing party of China, the Kuomintang was led by Chiang Kai-shek during the Chinese civil war, where it served as the opposing force to the Red Army and the Communist Party, inflicting significant losses on Communist forces. During this period, the Kuomintang was recognized by most countries as China's rightful government.\n\nDuring World War II, the Kuomintang's Nationalist armies, under Chiang Kai-shek's leadership, defended against Japanese attackers and bore the brunt of the fighting. However, the party's fortunes changed dramatically during the civil war. In 1935, Kuomintang forces captured and executed Fang Zhimin, a Communist leader. Despite such victories, the Kuomintang ultimately lost the civil war to the Communist forces.\n\nIn the late 1940s, the Kuomintang government published maps asserting territorial claims in the South China Sea, establishing positions that would have lasting implications for regional disputes. Following their defeat in 1949, the Kuomintang fled to Taiwan, bringing many mainlanders (waishengren) to the island. These party members and supporters became a significant demographic group in Taiwan's political landscape.\n\nAfter relocating to Taiwan, the Kuomintang imposed authoritarian rule over the island and governed for fifty-five years until 2000. During this period, the party maintained its claim as the legitimate government of all China and pursued Project National Glory, an ambitious plan to retake the mainland. The party's delegation was ejected from the United Nations in 1971, marking a significant diplomatic setback as international recognition shifted to the People's Republic of China.\n\nOver time, the Kuomintang's stance toward mainland China evolved considerably. The party gradually shed its historical enmity with the Communist Party and began advocating for warmer relations with Beijing. This approach was based on a shared belief in \"one China,\" and the party engaged in diplomatic negotiations with Beijing regarding cross-strait relations.\n\nIn recent years, the Kuomintang has experienced significant political challenges. The party won local elections in Taiwan in 2018, demonstrating continued electoral viability. However, it was defeated in the 2020 presidential election, leading to internal turmoil. The party has since experienced infighting and an identity crisis, particularly regarding its China policy, as it struggles to balance its historical connections to mainland China with the evolving political sentiments in Taiwan.\n\nThroughout its history, the Kuomintang has remained central to cross-strait relations between Taiwan and China, playing a pivotal role in shaping the political dynamics of the region.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"citations": null, "thinking_blocks": null}}}], "created": 1769998311, "model": "claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 605, "prompt_tokens": 545, "total_tokens": 1150, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": null, "audio_tokens": null, "reasoning_tokens": null, "rejected_prediction_tokens": null, "text_tokens": 605}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null, "cache_creation_tokens": 0, "cache_creation_token_details": {"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens": 0, "ephemeral_1h_input_tokens": 0}}, "cache_creation_input_tokens": 0, "cache_read_input_tokens": 0}, "formatted_response": null, "content": "# Comprehensive Summary: KUOMINTANG\n\nThe Kuomintang is a major political party with a complex and extensive history spanning mainland China and Taiwan.
