According to the party charter, the Central Committee is responsible for choosing the General Secretary, who serves as its leader, and deciding the membership of the Central Military Commission.\n\n## Membership and Structure\n\nThe Central Committee comprises 344 members, including both full members and nonvoting alternate members. Membership in this elite body represents a significant achievement in a party official's career trajectory. Historical examples include Xi Jinping, who joined as a nonvoting alternate member in 1997, and Xi Zhongxun, who was promoted to the Central Committee in 1956. More recently, officials like Qin and Gao were elevated to full membership in fall 2022, demonstrating the body's ongoing role in recognizing rising party leaders.\n\n## Key Functions and Responsibilities\n\nThe Central Committee exercises broad authority across multiple domains. It oversees governmental functions, including stock market oversight, and plays a crucial role in party leadership transitions. Theoretically, the Central Committee would assemble to select a new party chief and military commission chairman should the current leader leave office suddenly.\n\n## Major Policy Decisions and Reforms\n\nThroughout its history, the Central Committee has been instrumental in shaping China's political and economic direction. In November 2013, this elite body made a landmark commitment to give market forces a decisive role in allocating resources, signaling significant economic reform. In fall 2014, the Central Committee convened its first-ever plenary session focused on the \"rule of law,\" unveiling broad overhauls for the judicial system.\n\nThe Central Committee has also passed important historical resolutions, including those in 1945 and 1981 on historical questions, with Deng Xiaoping's resolution receiving unanimous approval in 1981. More recently, in late 2019, the Central Committee approved a comprehensive strategy for remaking Hong Kong's political, economic, education, and policing systems.\n\n## Leadership Recognition\n\nThe Central Committee serves as the formal body for recognizing party leadership, having acclaimed Xi Jinping as the core of the party's fifth-generation leadership. Historically, it has also been the venue for significant political moments, such as when Mao Zedong read aloud Kang Sheng's note condemning Xi Zhongxun during a party meeting.\n\nAs the party's supreme governing institution, the Central Committee continues to shape China's domestic and international policies while maintaining its role as the ultimate authority in party affairs and national governance.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"citations": null, "thinking_blocks": null}}}], "created": 1769998158, "model": "claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 571, "prompt_tokens": 558, "total_tokens": 1129, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": null, "audio_tokens": null, "reasoning_tokens": null, "rejected_prediction_tokens": null, "text_tokens": 571}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null, "cache_creation_tokens": 0, "cache_creation_token_details": {"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens": 0, "ephemeral_1h_input_tokens": 0}}, "cache_creation_input_tokens": 0, "cache_read_input_tokens": 0}, "formatted_response": null, "content": "# CENTRAL COMMITTEE - Comprehensive Summary\n\nThe Central Committee is the highest governing body and elite decision-making organ of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), serving as a key institution responsible for major policy decisions and party governance.
