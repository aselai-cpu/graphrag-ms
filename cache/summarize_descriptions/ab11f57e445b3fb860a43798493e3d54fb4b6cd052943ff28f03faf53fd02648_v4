Through his research, Tiffert made an important discovery regarding the digitization of Chinese legal journals, uncovering systematic omissions of sensitive articles from these digitized collections.\n\nTiffert's findings reveal a pattern of selective digitization in China's legal scholarship archives, where articles deemed sensitive by authorities have been systematically excluded from digital databases. This discovery has important implications for researchers, legal scholars, and anyone relying on digitized Chinese legal materials, as it demonstrates that digital collections may not provide a complete or accurate representation of China's published legal scholarship. The omissions suggest a deliberate effort to control access to certain legal discussions and analyses that may be considered politically or socially sensitive by Chinese authorities.\n\nThis work by Glenn Tiffert highlights broader concerns about information control and censorship in China, particularly as it relates to academic and legal materials. His research underscores the challenges faced by scholars studying Chinese law and policy when digital archives may be incomplete or curated to exclude certain content.
