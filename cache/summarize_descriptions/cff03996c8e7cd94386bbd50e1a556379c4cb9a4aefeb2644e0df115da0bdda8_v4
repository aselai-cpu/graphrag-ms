The organization reported on China's COVID-19 infection rates during the Lunar New Year period, providing international audiences with critical information about the pandemic's progression in the country where it first emerged. CNN also covered coronavirus conspiracy theories, including those promoted by Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian, who spread unsubstantiated claims about the virus's origins. Additionally, CNN published articles examining various coronavirus conspiracy theories more broadly, contributing to public understanding and fact-checking efforts during the pandemic. The news organization also reported on an incident in October 2020 when Chinese President Xi Jinping was observed coughing during a speech, which drew public attention given the ongoing pandemic context.\n\nBeyond health-related coverage, CNN has reported on significant political and social issues within China. The organization covered the story of a Chinese journalist who courageously confronted a corrupt official, highlighting issues of corruption and press freedom in China. CNN also investigated and reported on China's controversial use of health codes—originally implemented for COVID-19 tracking—to prevent and suppress protests, revealing how public health infrastructure was being repurposed for social control.\n\nIn the area of international relations and military affairs, CNN has documented tensions between the United States and China. The news organization reported on the US Navy's encounters with Chinese forces, specifically covering instances of unsafe or unprofessional interactions that have occurred since 2016. This reporting has helped inform the public about the increasing military tensions and maritime disputes in the Indo-Pacific region.\n\nThrough its comprehensive coverage of these diverse topics, CNN has established itself as a significant source of information regarding Chinese domestic affairs, international relations, and global health issues.
