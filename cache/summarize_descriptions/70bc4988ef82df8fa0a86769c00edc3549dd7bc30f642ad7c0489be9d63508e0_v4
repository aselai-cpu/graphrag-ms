Through his investigative journalism, Chin has covered several significant aspects of Xi Jinping's leadership and political activities.\n\nChin co-wrote about a notable incident in September 2012 when Xi Jinping mysteriously disappeared from public view, an event that generated considerable speculation and international attention during a critical period in Chinese politics. This disappearance occurred shortly before Xi was expected to assume China's top leadership position.\n\nA major focus of Josh Chin's reporting has been Xi Jinping's policies and actions in Xinjiang. Chin wrote extensively about leaked documents that revealed Xi Jinping's substantial and direct involvement in the crackdown in the Xinjiang region. These reports highlighted the extensive role that Xi personally played in directing policies affecting the Uyghur population and other ethnic minorities in the region. The leaked documents provided crucial evidence of the scope and nature of Xi's involvement in what has become one of the most controversial aspects of his leadership.\n\nAdditionally, Josh Chin has reported on Xi Jinping's broader approach to governance and control. He covered Xi's crackdown on dissenting versions of history, illustrating the Chinese leader's efforts to maintain strict control over historical narratives and suppress alternative interpretations that might challenge the Communist Party's official positions. This reporting demonstrates Xi's commitment to ideological control and his intolerance for perspectives that deviate from the party line.\n\nChin's journalism has also examined Xi Jinping's leadership style, particularly his tendency toward micromanagement.
