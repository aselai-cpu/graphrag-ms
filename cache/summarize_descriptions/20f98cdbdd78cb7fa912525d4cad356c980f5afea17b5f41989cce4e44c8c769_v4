The publication became notably entangled in China's regulatory environment when an issue focusing on the Qing dynasty's collapse was subjected to an extensive three-year government review process. This prolonged scrutiny appears to have had a substantial impact on the magazine's operations, as Oriental History Review has not published any new issues since 2020.\n\nThe magazine's experience reflects the complex relationship between independent historical publications and government oversight in China, particularly when dealing with sensitive historical topics such as dynastic transitions and political upheaval. The Qing dynasty, which ruled China from 1644 to 1912, represents a crucial period in Chinese history, and its collapse marked the end of imperial rule and the beginning of the Republican era. The fact that content examining this historical transition required such extensive government review suggests the continued sensitivity of topics related to political change and governmental legitimacy in contemporary China.\n\nOriental History Review is also referenced on page 173 of an unspecified source, indicating that the publication has garnered attention or citation in academic or journalistic contexts. Despite its current publication hiatus, the magazine appears to have established enough of a presence in the field of historical scholarship or popular history to warrant mention in other works.\n\nThe magazine's status as an independent publication in Beijing is particularly noteworthy, as independent media outlets in China often face various challenges in maintaining editorial autonomy while navigating regulatory requirements. The three-year review period and subsequent cessation of publication since 2020 suggest that Oriental History Review may have encountered insurmountable obstacles in continuing its operations under current conditions.\n\nAs of the most recent information available, Oriental History Review remains in a state of suspended publication, with its last issues dating back to 2020.
