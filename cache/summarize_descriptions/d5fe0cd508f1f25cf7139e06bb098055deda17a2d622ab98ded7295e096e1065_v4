His reporting encompasses multiple dimensions of China's political, social, and international landscape.\n\n## Political Coverage\n\nWong has reported extensively on China's elite politics, Communist Party doctrine, and political leadership. His work has covered political developments within China's communist system, including the country's suppression of liberal thought and democracy. He has documented dissent and political developments within the country, as well as China's push to purge organized crime and its impact on private businesses. Additionally, Wong reported on corruption and investigations within China's military establishment.\n\n## Human Rights and Social Issues\n\nA significant portion of Wong's reporting has focused on human rights issues in China. He covered China's Muslim crackdown and related UN reports, documented the sentencing of Chinese labor activists, and reported on the country's surveillance practices and use of facial recognition technology. His work has shed light on China's national security law and the broader implications for civil liberties within the country.\n\n## Diplomatic and International Affairs\n\nWong has extensively reported on China's diplomatic policies and ambassador appointments, as well as China's territorial push and military activities. His coverage includes China-U.S. relations and Chinese political figures, U.S.-Beijing disputes, and China's anger at South Korea. He also reported on China's controversial position urging open borders during an outbreak, highlighting the country's international policy stances.\n\n## Notable Reporting Incidents\n\nWong reported on the release of a Bloomberg News staffer by China, demonstrating his coverage of press freedom issues. His reporting on Xi Jinping and Chinese politics was particularly significant and consequential—ultimately leading to Wong being forced to leave China due to his journalism work.\n\n## Reporting Focus\n\nThroughout his career covering China, Wong has maintained a focus on critical areas including elite politics, Communist Party doctrine, human rights violations, diplomatic affairs, surveillance and political practices, and the broader implications of China's authoritarian governance system.
