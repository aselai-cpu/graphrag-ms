The nation has been involved in multiple military conflicts, most notably its invasion of Ukraine, as well as its earlier invasion of Georgia and annexation of Crimea. These military experiences have provided validation for asymmetric warfare strategies, which have been studied and advocated by strategists in other countries, including Taiwan. Russia's war in Ukraine has had far-reaching implications, influencing defense strategies in nations like Taiwan that are examining lessons from the conflict.\n\nThe relationship between Russia and China has been particularly noteworthy, especially in the context of the Ukraine crisis. China has embraced Russia during this period, with Xi Jinping cultivating Russia as a strategic partner for years. This partnership has remained strong even after Moscow's invasion of Ukraine in 2022, with China continuing to back Russia despite international condemnation. China's support has been economically significant, as it propped up the Russian economy amid Western sanctions imposed over the war in Ukraine. This economic lifeline has been crucial for Russia's ability to withstand international pressure.\n\nGeographically and historically, Russia occupies territory that was once part of the Qing dynasty, adding a historical dimension to the Sino-Russian relationship. Culturally, Russia has also featured in Chinese leadership discourse, with Xi Jinping claiming to have read works by renowned Russian writers including Chekhov, Dostoevsky, and Tolstoy, suggesting an appreciation for Russian literary and cultural contributions.\n\nInterestingly, while China maintains close ties with Russia, Chinese leadership has also been cautious about certain aspects of the Russian system. Specifically, China has expressed a desire to avoid replicating Russia's powerful oligarch class, indicating that while the two countries are strategic partners, China is selective about which elements of the Russian model it wishes to emulate.\n\nIn summary, Russia is a major geopolitical actor under Vladimir Putin's leadership, engaged in significant military conflicts that have reshaped international relations and military thinking. Its strategic partnership with China has intensified during periods of international crisis, particularly surrounding the Ukraine war, with China providing crucial economic support.
