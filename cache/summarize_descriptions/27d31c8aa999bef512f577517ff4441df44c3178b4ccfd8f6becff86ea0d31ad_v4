This tumultuous period in Chinese history began in the summer of 1966 and continued until 1976, spanning a decade of political and social upheaval.\n\nMao launched the Cultural Revolution with specific strategic objectives: to reclaim his authority within the Communist Party and to destroy the party bureaucracy that he perceived as threatening his power. During this campaign, numerous senior officials were targeted and purged, including Liu Shaoqi and other high-ranking party members who fell victim to the political persecution that characterized this era.\n\nAs the leader of China throughout the Cultural Revolution period, Mao maintained his position at the helm of the movement. However, despite being its architect and driving force, the Cultural Revolution eventually spiraled beyond Mao's control, taking on a momentum and direction that exceeded his original intentions. This loss of control contributed to the widespread chaos and destruction that marked the period.\n\nThe Cultural Revolution had devastating consequences for China's development. The movement destroyed economic gains that had been achieved in previous years, setting back the country's progress and causing significant material and human costs. The period was characterized by political violence, social disruption, and the persecution of intellectuals, officials, and ordinary citizens deemed enemies of the revolution.\n\nMao's leadership style during the Cultural Revolution was later subject to official criticism and condemnation. In 1981, the Chinese Communist Party passed a resolution that specifically condemned Mao's megalomania and arbitrary rule during the Cultural Revolution period.
