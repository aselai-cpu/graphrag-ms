During Hu Jintao's administration, Xi served in a subordinate capacity, helping to shape Beijing's responses to various challenges while simultaneously preparing his own strategies for future leadership. The transition period saw Xi initially assessed by observers as sharing Hu's commitment to maintaining stable relations with the United States.\n\n## Policy Continuities and Departures\n\nWhile Xi Jinping extended certain hawkish trajectories that had begun under Hu Jintao's leadership, he did so with far more boldness and vigor than his predecessor. The two leaders demonstrated some alignment during critical moments, such as when Hu Jintao agreed with Xi's argument for conducting broader investigations into the Wang Lijun case, suggesting cooperation during the transition period.\n\nHowever, Xi's leadership marked dramatic departures from Hu's governance model. Most notably, Xi reversed Hu's policies of delegating autonomy to lower-level security authorities, instead centralizing control. This represented a fundamental shift in how power and authority were distributed within China's political system.\n\n## Anti-Corruption Campaigns\n\nOne of the most significant areas of divergence involved anti-corruption efforts. While Hu Jintao had pursued anti-corruption measures during his tenure, Xi Jinping dramatically expanded these efforts beyond his predecessor's approach after assuming leadership. Xi's anti-corruption campaign was far more extensive and aggressive, becoming a defining feature of his administration and a tool for consolidating power.\n\n## Political Consequences\n\nXi's aggressive consolidation of power had direct consequences for Hu Jintao's legacy and influence. Xi's purge of Ling Jihua, one of Hu's key protégés, significantly sapped Hu Jintao's influence as a former leader. As Xi faced potential meddling from Hu's protégés early in his tenure, these purges served both anti-corruption and political purposes.\n\nFurthermore, Xi's historical resolution implicitly criticized problems that remained unresolved during Hu's governance, though it avoided naming Hu directly. This subtle critique suggested Xi's positioning of his own leadership as correcting deficiencies from the previous era.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe relationship between Xi Jinping and Hu Jintao illustrates both continuity and transformation in Chinese leadership. While Xi built upon certain foundations laid during Hu's tenure, he fundamentally restructured governance approaches, centralized authority, and pursued far more aggressive policies that distinguished his leadership and diminished his predecessor's lingering influence.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"citations": null, "thinking_blocks": null}}}], "created": 1769998576, "model": "claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 617, "prompt_tokens": 451, "total_tokens": 1068, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": null, "audio_tokens": null, "reasoning_tokens": null, "rejected_prediction_tokens": null, "text_tokens": 617}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null, "cache_creation_tokens": 0, "cache_creation_token_details": {"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens": 0, "ephemeral_1h_input_tokens": 0}}, "cache_creation_input_tokens": 0, "cache_read_input_tokens": 0}, "formatted_response": null, "content": "# Comprehensive Summary: Xi Jinping and Hu Jintao\n\nXi Jinping and Hu Jintao represent two successive generations of Chinese leadership, with their relationship characterized by both continuity and significant divergence in governance approaches.\n\n## Leadership Transition\n\nXi Jinping succeeded Hu Jintao as general secretary and Chinese leader in 2012, following Hu's final year in power.
