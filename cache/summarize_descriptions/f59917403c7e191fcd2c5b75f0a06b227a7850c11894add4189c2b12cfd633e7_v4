The sultanate maintains territorial claims in this disputed area that directly overlap with China's controversial nine-dash line claim.\n\nThe South China Sea represents a complex geopolitical flashpoint where multiple countries assert competing sovereignty claims over various islands, reefs, and maritime zones. Brunei's claims in the South China Sea are part of this broader regional dispute, which also involves other claimants including China, Vietnam, the Philippines, Malaysia, and Taiwan.\n\nChina's nine-dash line is a demarcation line used by the People's Republic of China to claim extensive portions of the South China Sea, encompassing approximately 90% of the waters. This expansive claim has been rejected by an international tribunal and is contested by several Southeast Asian nations, including Brunei. The overlap between Brunei's territorial claims and China's nine-dash line places the small sultanate in a position of territorial disagreement with one of the world's major powers.\n\nBrunei's specific claims in the South China Sea are relatively modest compared to some other claimants, but they are nonetheless significant for the nation's sovereignty and potential access to maritime resources, including fishing grounds and potential oil and gas deposits beneath the seabed. The South China Sea is believed to contain substantial hydrocarbon reserves and serves as a critical shipping route for global trade, making territorial control of these waters economically valuable.\n\nDespite having overlapping claims with China, Brunei has generally maintained a low-profile approach to the South China Sea disputes compared to other claimant states.
