During this visit, Biden's impression of Xi Jinping was notably positive; he found the Chinese leader to be seemingly open-minded and candid in their discussions. This early assessment was significant as it occurred during a crucial period when Xi Jinping was ascending to power in China, and the United States was seeking to understand the future direction of Sino-American relations under his leadership.\n\nTwo years later, in 2013, Joe Biden made another trip to Beijing where he continued his diplomatic engagement with Xi Jinping. During this visit, Biden raised the sensitive matter of journalist visa renewals with Xi Jinping. This issue was particularly important as it related to press freedom and the ability of American journalists to work and report from China, reflecting broader concerns about media access and freedom of information in the bilateral relationship.\n\nThese interactions between Joe Biden and Xi Jinping during the early 2010s established a foundation of direct communication between the two leaders.
