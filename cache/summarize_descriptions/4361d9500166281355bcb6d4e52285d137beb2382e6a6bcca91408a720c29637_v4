It is described as a festive season characterized by kindness, forgiveness, charity, and a time when people open their hearts to one another. The holiday represents a period when charitable giving is particularly encouraged, and when the contrast between Want and Abundance becomes most apparent in society.\n\nThroughout the narrative, Christmas is portrayed through multiple perspectives and experiences. Scrooge initially dismisses Christmas as a \"humbug,\" railing against the holiday and its celebrations. In stark contrast, Fred and his family, along with numerous other characters, embrace Christmas with merriment, dinner, music, and joyous gatherings. The holiday is celebrated with various traditions including singing Christmas songs, sharing Christmas thoughts, exchanging wishes of \"Merry Christmas,\" and gathering for festive meals and entertainment.\n\nThe visual and material aspects of Christmas are vividly depicted through scenes featuring toys, presents, family gatherings, and shops displaying festive goods. Christmas morning is portrayed as a particularly celebratory time, with people engaging in festivities and the streets alive with holiday spirit. The holiday is also referenced in its spiritual dimension, with mentions of its Founder as a child, emphasizing Christmas as a time to embrace childlike wonder and innocence.\n\nChristmas serves as the backdrop for Scrooge's journey through time, appearing in his memories, present observations, and the transformation he ultimately undergoes. In his past, Christmas was a painful reminder of loneliness, as young Scrooge was left alone at school while other children went home to celebrate with their families. Through the various scenes shown to Scrooge during his supernatural visitations, he witnesses how others celebrate Christmas—through gatherings, travels, and expressions of joy and togetherness.\n\nThe holiday ultimately becomes the vehicle for Scrooge's redemption and transformation. By the story's conclusion, Christmas represents the celebration that Scrooge learns to \"keep well,\" marking his complete change of heart and character. The transformation takes place during this Christmas season, symbolizing rebirth, renewal, and the triumph of generosity and human connection over isolation and miserliness.
