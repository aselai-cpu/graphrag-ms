The Qing Dynasty, which had ruled China since 1644, was led by the Manchu ethnic minority, and Sun Yat-sen leveraged ethnic tensions and nationalist sentiments among the Han Chinese majority to build support for his revolutionary cause. By emphasizing the foreign origins of the Manchu rulers and framing the struggle as one of national liberation, he was able to galvanize opposition to the imperial system while simultaneously promoting his vision of establishing a Chinese republic based on modern democratic principles.\n\nFollowing the collapse of the Qing Dynasty, Sun Yat-sen dedicated his efforts to building a constitutional republic that would replace the centuries-old imperial system. His vision for post-Qing China centered on creating a modern nation-state governed by constitutional law rather than dynastic authority.
