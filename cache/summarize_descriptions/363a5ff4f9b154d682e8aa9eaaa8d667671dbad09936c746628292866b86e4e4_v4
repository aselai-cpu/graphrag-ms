He currently serves as a Foreign Ministry Spokesperson for the People's Republic of China, a position to which he was appointed in August 2019.\n\nPrior to his appointment as spokesman, Zhao served as deputy chief of mission in Pakistan, where he developed his distinctive diplomatic approach. His career trajectory represents a significant shift in Chinese diplomatic style, as he has become emblematic of what is known as \"Wolf Warrior\" diplomacy—a more aggressive and confrontational approach to representing Chinese interests on the global stage.\n\nZhao is particularly notable for his active and combative presence on social media, especially Twitter. He opened a Twitter account around the time of his appointment as foreign ministry spokesman in August 2019, and has since used the platform to engage in controversial exchanges and promote Chinese government positions. His social media activity has included acerbic takedowns of Western powers, which has earned him significant attention both domestically and internationally.\n\nHis confrontational style has resonated with audiences in China, where he has developed fan clubs on Chinese social media platforms. These supporters appreciate his willingness to challenge Western narratives and defend Chinese positions forcefully, marking a departure from the traditionally reserved approach of Chinese diplomacy.\n\nHowever, Zhao has also been at the center of several major controversies. He engaged in controversial Twitter exchanges about race in Washington D.C., which drew international criticism. Most notably, he gained widespread international attention for promoting a conspiracy theory suggesting that the U.S. military brought the coronavirus to Wuhan, China. This claim, made during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic, significantly escalated tensions between China and the United States and exemplified the confrontational nature of his diplomatic approach.\n\nZhao's role as a \"Wolf Warrior\" diplomat represents a broader shift in Chinese foreign policy under Xi Jinping's leadership, moving away from Deng Xiaoping's doctrine of \"hide your strength, bide your time\" toward a more assertive and nationalistic stance on the world stage. His appointment and prominence signal China's willingness to engage in more direct confrontation with Western powers, particularly the United States, in defense of its interests and reputation.\n\nAs a Foreign Ministry Spokesperson, Zhao Lijian continues to be a central figure in China's public diplomacy efforts, embodying the country's increasingly confident and combative approach to international relations in the 21st century.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"citations": null, "thinking_blocks": null}}}], "created": 1769998356, "model": "claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 544, "prompt_tokens": 349, "total_tokens": 893, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": null, "audio_tokens": null, "reasoning_tokens": null, "rejected_prediction_tokens": null, "text_tokens": 544}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null, "cache_creation_tokens": 0, "cache_creation_token_details": {"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens": 0, "ephemeral_1h_input_tokens": 0}}, "cache_creation_input_tokens": 0, "cache_read_input_tokens": 0}, "formatted_response": null, "content": "# Zhao Lijian - Comprehensive Summary\n\nZhao Lijian is a forty-seven-year-old Chinese diplomat who has become one of the most prominent and controversial figures in China's modern diplomatic corps.
