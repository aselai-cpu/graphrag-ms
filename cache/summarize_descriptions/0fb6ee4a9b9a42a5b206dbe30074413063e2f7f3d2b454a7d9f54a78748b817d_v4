The publication is edited by Hu Xijin and functions as a party tabloid that actively promotes Chinese government positions and nationalist perspectives.\n\nAs a media organization, Global Times plays a significant role in China's diplomatic and cultural messaging. The publication has been notably active in defending Chinese diplomats, including Zhao Lijian, and has engaged in Twitter exchanges supporting Chinese diplomatic officials. This demonstrates its role as a defender of Chinese government positions in international discourse.\n\nGlobal Times covers a wide range of topics relevant to Chinese domestic and foreign policy. In the realm of international relations, the newspaper has published extensive coverage about Singapore and the South China Sea, including critical reports about Singapore's actions at the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM) summit in 2016. Specifically, the tabloid claimed that Singapore lobbied for references to the Hague tribunal ruling regarding the South China Sea dispute, reflecting its role in advancing China's territorial claims and criticizing perceived opposition.\n\nThe publication also serves as a platform for promoting Chinese cultural exports and soft power initiatives. Global Times published articles about \"The Battle at Lake Changjin,\" a patriotic Chinese war film, both as a cultural export and through commentary praising the film. This coverage illustrates the tabloid's function in promoting nationalist cultural products that align with the Communist Party's ideological messaging.\n\nIn domestic affairs, Global Times covers topics related to the Communist Party's influence in Chinese society and business. The newspaper published articles about Xiaomi's establishment of a party committee, highlighting the integration of party structures within private enterprises. Additionally, the publication has covered topics related to legal activists and the rule of law in China, though from a perspective aligned with party interests.\n\nGlobal Times has also engaged with online movements and controversies, publishing articles about the Great Translation Movement and other topics that relate to China's international image and domestic political discourse. Through its coverage, the tabloid consistently works to shape narratives in favor of Chinese government positions while criticizing perceived adversaries or challenges to China's interests.\n\nOverall, Global Times functions as a key instrument of Chinese state media, combining nationalist rhetoric with coverage of diplomatic, cultural, and domestic issues, all while maintaining a strong pro-government editorial stance under the leadership of Hu Xijin.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"citations": null, "thinking_blocks": null}}}], "created": 1769998307, "model": "claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 507, "prompt_tokens": 383, "total_tokens": 890, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": null, "audio_tokens": null, "reasoning_tokens": null, "rejected_prediction_tokens": null, "text_tokens": 507}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null, "cache_creation_tokens": 0, "cache_creation_token_details": {"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens": 0, "ephemeral_1h_input_tokens": 0}}, "cache_creation_input_tokens": 0, "cache_read_input_tokens": 0}, "formatted_response": null, "content": "# Comprehensive Summary: Global Times\n\nGlobal Times is a Chinese state media publication and Communist Party-run tabloid that serves as a prominent nationalistic voice in China's media landscape.
