The transition of power between these two leaders was marked by both continuity and political tension.\n\nJiang Zemin formally handed over leadership to Hu Jintao, but the transition was complicated by Jiang's retention of significant influence. Specifically, Jiang Zemin remained chairman of the military commission for two additional years following the handover, which resulted in Hu Jintao having only tenuous authority during the initial period of his leadership. This arrangement created a power-sharing dynamic that limited Hu's ability to fully consolidate control at the outset of his tenure.\n\nDespite these initial constraints, Hu Jintao demonstrated both continuity with and divergence from his predecessor's policies. On the continuity side, Hu Jintao maintained and advanced several of Jiang Zemin's key initiatives. He continued the People's Liberation Army (PLA) modernization efforts that had been prioritized under Jiang's leadership. Additionally, Hu pursued Jiang's policies on legal reforms and continued the broader strategy of integrating China with the international order, suggesting a commitment to China's ongoing engagement with global institutions and norms.\n\nHowever, Hu Jintao also took decisive actions against Jiang Zemin's political network, particularly targeting what was known as the Shanghai Gang clique—a group of officials associated with Jiang's power base in Shanghai. The most notable example of this political maneuvering was Hu Jintao's dismissal of Chen Liangyu, a high-ranking official connected to Jiang's camp. This move represented a direct strike at Jiang Zemin's sphere of influence and demonstrated Hu's determination to establish his own authority and reduce the power of his predecessor's allies within the Chinese Communist Party structure.\n\nThe relationship between Hu Jintao and Jiang Zemin thus exemplifies the complex dynamics of leadership succession in China's political system, characterized by a careful balance between maintaining policy continuity and consolidating personal power. While Hu honored his predecessor's legacy in areas such as military modernization, legal reform, and international integration, he simultaneously worked to diminish Jiang's residual influence by systematically dismantling his political network.
