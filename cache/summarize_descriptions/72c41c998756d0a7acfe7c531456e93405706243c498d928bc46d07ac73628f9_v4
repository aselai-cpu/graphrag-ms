Founded on August 1, after which the Bayi School was named, the PLA serves as the primary military force controlled by the Communist Party.\n\n## Historical Operations and Expansion\n\nThe PLA entered Xinjiang in 1949, marking an important phase in China's territorial consolidation. Historically, the organization conducted military operations against Taiwan, including artillery bombardment of the Kinmen Islands and various naval engagements. These operations established a pattern of military involvement in Taiwan affairs that continues to the present day.\n\n## Taiwan Focus and Military Capabilities\n\nTaiwan remains a strategic priority for the PLA, which conducts ongoing operations near the island including aerial bombing, missile strikes, naval blockades, and amphibious landing preparations. The PLA maintains a formidable fleet of more than 2,500 fighters, bombers, and other aircraft. The military force significantly outnumbers Taiwanese forces and has been modernized with advanced weapons systems, including carrier-killer missiles, giving it substantial conventional military superiority in the region.\n\n## Modernization and Restructuring\n\nThe PLA has undergone significant transformation over recent decades. Modernization attempts were initiated under Jiang Zemin and Hu Jintao, with both leaders maintaining close associations with the military organization. Under Xi Jinping's leadership, the PLA experienced major restructuring and purges, alongside a period of downsizing aimed at creating a more efficient fighting force. These reforms have focused on peacetime operations and enhanced military readiness.\n\n## Xi Jinping's Connection to the PLA\n\nXi Jinping has had significant involvement and influence with the PLA throughout his career. At age twenty-five, Xi enlisted in the PLA to serve as one of three secretaries to Geng Biao. During his time in Fujian, Xi familiarized himself with military affairs by holding concurrent military roles, building ties with the politically influential organization through his military background.\n\n## Organizational Culture and Ideology\n\nThe PLA maintains strict ideological standards in its personnel selection. Officers are promoted based on ethnic, class, and ideological backgrounds that make them unlikely to support anti-regime protesters, ensuring loyalty to the Communist Party. The military's ideological education extends beyond its ranks; PLA personnel have taught kindergarten pupils in Guangzhou to dress in military fatigues, march, perform salutes, and practice combat drills, demonstrating the organization's role in promoting military culture throughout Chinese society.\n\nNotably, Peng Liyuan, Xi Jinping's wife, served in the PLA as a folk singer, further illustrating the organization's cultural dimensions alongside its military functions.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"citations": null, "thinking_blocks": null}}}], "created": 1769998176, "model": "claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 602, "prompt_tokens": 707, "total_tokens": 1309, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": null, "audio_tokens": null, "reasoning_tokens": null, "rejected_prediction_tokens": null, "text_tokens": 602}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null, "cache_creation_tokens": 0, "cache_creation_token_details": {"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens": 0, "ephemeral_1h_input_tokens": 0}}, "cache_creation_input_tokens": 0, "cache_read_input_tokens": 0}, "formatted_response": null, "content": "# People's Liberation Army (PLA)\n\nThe People's Liberation Army (PLA) is China's armed forces and the military organization of the Communist Party of China.
