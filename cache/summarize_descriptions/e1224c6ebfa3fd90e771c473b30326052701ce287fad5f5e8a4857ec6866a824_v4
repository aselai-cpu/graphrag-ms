By 2010, China had become the world's second-biggest economy, trailing the U.S., which had a Gini coefficient of roughly 0.48 at the time, lower than China's 0.61.\n\n**Diplomatic Relations and Historical Context**\n\nThe U.S. established full diplomatic relations with China in 1979, having previously cut formal ties with Taipei. Early relations were marked by the U.S. characterization as showing aggression toward North Korea during the early years of the People's Republic, and involvement in post-Korean War talks in Geneva. The U.S. pursued a strategy of encouraging peaceful evolution in socialist regimes. Following the Tiananmen massacre, the U.S. imposed an arms embargo on China and led Western Europe in suspending China ties. Xi Jinping has visited the U.S. on multiple occasions, including a 2015 visit where Jack Ma spoke at a meeting with Chinese and American executives.\n\n**Strategic Competition and Military Tensions**\n\nThe U.S. maintains a strong military presence in the Western Pacific, asserts freedom of navigation in disputed waters, and has formed security alliances throughout Asia. American defense reforms have inspired Chinese military changes. The U.S. has shared nuclear submarine technology with Australia and maintains strong ties with Singapore as part of the Western liberal democratic order. Tensions include South China Sea disputes, with Xi calling on the U.S. to consider Beijing a peer in a new model of major-power relations. The U.S. deployed warships during the 1995-1996 Taiwan crisis and intervened in the Kosovo War.\n\n**Economic and Technological Rivalry**\n\nThe countries are engaged in a trade war and technological competition. Bo Xilai engaged in trade talks with the U.S. as commerce minister. The U.S. kept watch on Alibaba during Trump's meeting with Jack Ma and has imposed investment restrictions on China. American technology is key to China's surveillance operations. Chinese education companies listed in the U.S. experienced panic selling after regulatory changes, and solar shipments were affected by U.S. import bans.\n\n**Human Rights and Political Tensions**\n\nConflicts have intensified over multiple issues including internet division, technology standards, coronavirus allegations, Uighur Muslim genocide claims (with the Senate passing legislation on Xinjiang imports), sanctions, and reciprocal journalist expulsions. Unfavorable views of China reached record levels in the U.S. in 2020, coinciding with the presidential election between Donald Trump and Joe Biden.\n\n**People and Migration**\n\nThe U.S. serves as a destination for Chinese individuals including Pei (who moved there in 2017), Chinese journalists pursuing graduate degrees, Guo Wengui (who operates from there), Cai Xia (traveling when unable to return due to Covid-19 restrictions), and exiled Tibetan filmmaker Dhondup Wangchen.
