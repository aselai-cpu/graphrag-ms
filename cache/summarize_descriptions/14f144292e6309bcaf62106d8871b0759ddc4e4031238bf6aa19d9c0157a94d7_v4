His primary concern appears to be financial rather than emotional or sympathetic, as he specifically notes that the deceased has not left him any money in their will or estate. This mercenary attitude is further emphasized by his focus on practical matters, particularly the deceased person's money and funeral arrangements, rather than expressing grief or offering condolences.\n\nThe Man with Large Chin represents a type of callous businessman more interested in financial gain and practical considerations than in human compassion. His yawning during these discussions and his frank admission about not receiving any inheritance paint him as someone who views the death primarily through a transactional lens. He engages with fellow merchants in what appears to be routine business conversation, treating the deceased's passing as a matter of financial interest rather than personal loss.\n\nThis character serves as an example of the cold, calculating nature of certain business circles, where relationships are measured in monetary terms and even death becomes an occasion to discuss financial implications rather than to mourn.
