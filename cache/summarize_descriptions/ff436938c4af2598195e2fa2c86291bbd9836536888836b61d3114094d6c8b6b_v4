His role in this office gave him direct insight into high-level governmental decisions and strategies concerning Hong Kong and Macau.\n\nIn his capacity as a former senior official, Chen Zuo'er has been noted for recalling directives from Chinese President Xi Jinping regarding Hong Kong independence. Specifically, he recalled Xi's \"combat orders\" on this sensitive political issue, indicating the firm stance of the Chinese leadership against any separatist movements in Hong Kong. This recollection underscores Chen's proximity to top-level decision-making processes and his role as a witness to critical policy directions during a pivotal period in Hong Kong's relationship with mainland China.\n\nChen Zuo'er has also contributed to academic and policy discourse through his written work. In July 2017, he authored an article titled \"A Century of Vicissitudes in Hong Kong and the Practice of One Country, Two Systems,\" which was published in The Forum of Leadership Science. This publication demonstrates his expertise on Hong Kong's historical trajectory and the implementation of the \"One Country, Two Systems\" framework—the constitutional principle that has governed Hong Kong since its handover from British to Chinese sovereignty in 1997. The article's title suggests a comprehensive examination of Hong Kong's tumultuous century of change and how the unique governance model has been applied in practice.\n\nThrough both his official role and his scholarly contributions, Chen Zuo'er has established himself as an important figure in understanding and shaping China's approach to Hong Kong. His dual perspective as both a policy implementer and an analytical commentator provides valuable insights into the complexities of maintaining Hong Kong's special status while ensuring alignment with Beijing's political objectives.
