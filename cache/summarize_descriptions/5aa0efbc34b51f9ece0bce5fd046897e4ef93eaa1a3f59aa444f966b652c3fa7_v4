The Chinese government asserts sovereignty over the self-ruled island of Taiwan, treating this claim as a fundamental aspect of its territorial integrity.\n\nBeijing has declared its desire to seize Taiwan and actively pursues unification through multiple strategic approaches. While Beijing officially seeks peaceful unification with Taiwan, it has not ruled out the use of military force to achieve this objective. The Chinese government has conducted military operations against Taiwan and engages in what is characterized as gray-zone warfare—sustained military, diplomatic, and economic pressure designed to wear down Taiwan's defenses over time without triggering open conflict.\n\nBeyond military measures, Beijing employs comprehensive economic and diplomatic strategies to advance its territorial claims. The Chinese government has attempted to persuade Taiwan economically while simultaneously blocking the island's international participation on the global stage. This multi-pronged approach combines incentives with coercive measures to isolate Taiwan diplomatically and limit its recognition as a separate entity.\n\nBeijing extends its territorial assertions beyond governmental relations by pressuring international companies and organizations to reflect its position on Taiwan. Notably, Beijing controls how airlines describe Taiwan, requiring them to align their terminology with Chinese claims. This reflects a broader pattern of leveraging economic influence to enforce its political position regarding Taiwan's status.\n\nThe relationship between Beijing and Taiwan (Taipei) has experienced periods of heightened tensions, including notably during Xi Jinping's time in Fujian province, which is located directly across the Taiwan Strait.
