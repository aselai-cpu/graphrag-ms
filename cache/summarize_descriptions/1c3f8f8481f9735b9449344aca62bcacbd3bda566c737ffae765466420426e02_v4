His leadership of the Chinese Communist Party began during a transformative period, marked notably by his conclusion of the Party's 7th National Congress in 1945, and continued until his death, during which he established enduring tactical and ideological frameworks.\n\nAs chairman, Mao Zedong developed distinctive slogans, practices, and ideological approaches that became synonymous with his era of leadership. These Mao-era tactics have proven remarkably durable, continuing to be employed by the Chinese Communist Party in subsequent decades. His leadership style was characterized by a cult of personality and one-man rule, concentrating significant power in his position and creating a highly personalized form of governance that left an indelible mark on the party's structure and culture.\n\nMao Zedong's legacy within the Chinese Communist Party remains complex and multifaceted. While he is revered as a nation-builder whose contributions were essential to the establishment of Communist China, his legacy continues to be actively debated and revised by historians, party members, and scholars. This ongoing reassessment reflects the complicated nature of his rule, which included both significant achievements in unifying China under Communist leadership and controversial policies that had profound consequences for the Chinese people.\n\nIn more recent times, the Chinese Communist Party under Xi Jinping has deliberately revived many of Mao Zedong's slogans, practices, and ideological approaches, demonstrating the enduring influence of Mao's leadership style on contemporary Chinese politics. This revival suggests that despite the passage of time and the evolution of the party, Mao's methods and philosophical framework continue to resonate with current party leadership and are viewed as relevant tools for governance and maintaining party authority.\n\nThe relationship between Mao Zedong and the Chinese Communist Party is thus one of mutual definition: Mao shaped the party through his leadership, tactical innovations, and ideological contributions, while the party has preserved and selectively revived his legacy, ensuring his continued centrality to its historical narrative and contemporary identity.
