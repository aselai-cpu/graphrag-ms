The company established its own party committee in 2015, marking a formal commitment to implementing party building work methods within its corporate framework.\n\nWhen the party committee was first established in 2015, it began with approximately one hundred initial members. This initiative experienced remarkable growth over the subsequent years, with membership expanding to more than 3,500 people within just four years. This substantial increase in party committee membership reflects both the company's growth and the deepening integration of party structures within the organization.\n\nXiaomi's relationship with China's political leadership extends to the highest levels. The company's executives had the opportunity to meet with President Xi Jinping at a conference in 2018, demonstrating the company's significance within China's technology sector and its alignment with national priorities.\n\nThe implementation of party building work methods at Xiaomi represents a broader trend among Chinese technology companies to incorporate Communist Party structures into their corporate governance. This integration allows the party to maintain influence over strategic business decisions and ensures that the company's operations align with the party's objectives and national policies.\n\nAs a major player in the smartphone manufacturing industry, Xiaomi's adoption of these party building practices illustrates how even commercially-driven technology companies in China navigate the relationship between business operations and political requirements.
