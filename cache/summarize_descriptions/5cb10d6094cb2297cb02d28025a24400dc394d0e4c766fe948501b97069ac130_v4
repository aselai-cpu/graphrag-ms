His involvement with this governing body spans both administrative and leadership capacities, demonstrating his central role in the party's operations and hierarchy.\n\nIn his administrative capacity, Xi Jinping supervised important party history projects, a responsibility that underscores his influence over the ideological and historical narrative of the Chinese Communist Party. As part of this supervisory role, Xi was responsible for submitting drafts of these party history projects to the Politburo for formal approval. This function highlights the procedural relationship between Xi Jinping and the Politburo, where he acted as a key figure in preparing materials for the committee's review and authorization.\n\nXi Jinping's relationship with the Politburo also extends to his membership within this elite body. He was nominated for the new Politburo, indicating recognition of his political standing and the confidence placed in him by party leadership. Beyond mere membership in the Politburo itself, Xi Jinping achieved an even more prestigious position by joining the Politburo Standing Committee, which represents the highest tier of political power within the Chinese Communist Party. The Standing Committee typically consists of the most senior leaders who make the most critical decisions affecting China's governance and policy direction.\n\nThese dual roles illustrate Xi Jinping's progression within the party structure—from being an administrator who prepared materials for Politburo consideration to becoming a member of the Politburo's innermost circle of power. This trajectory reflects both his growing influence within the party apparatus and the trust placed in him by other senior party members.
