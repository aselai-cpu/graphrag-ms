As a U.S. official, he publicly alleged that the coronavirus could be traced to a laboratory in Wuhan, China, specifically suggesting that Covid-19 originated from a Chinese laboratory. These allegations became a major point of tension in U.S.-China relations and sparked international debate about the pandemic's origins.\n\nBeyond the coronavirus controversy, Pompeo took a strong stance on human rights issues in China, particularly regarding the treatment of Uyghur Muslims in Xinjiang province.

This designation represented a significant escalation in U.S. criticism of China's domestic policies and human rights record.\n\nPompeo's rhetoric extended beyond governmental criticism to direct appeals to the Chinese people themselves.
