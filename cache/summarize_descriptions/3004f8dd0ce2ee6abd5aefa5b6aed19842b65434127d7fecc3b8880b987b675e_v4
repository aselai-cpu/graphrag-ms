This approval from the central government led to Chen receiving a significant appointment to Xinjiang, an autonomous region in northwestern China known for its strategic importance and complex governance challenges. Beijing's decision to appoint Chen to this sensitive position suggests that the central government valued his assertive leadership style and believed it would be effective in managing the region's affairs.\n\nHowever, Chen's relationship with Beijing became strained during his tenure in another major Chinese city—Shanghai. While serving in Shanghai, Chen adopted a governance approach that emphasized the city's autonomy, which brought him into conflict with the central government. Chen's efforts to exert Shanghai's independence from Beijing's control resulted in him \"picking too many fights\" with the central authorities. This suggests that Chen pushed back against Beijing's directives or attempted to expand Shanghai's decision-making powers beyond what the central government deemed acceptable.\n\nThe apparent contradiction between Beijing initially favoring Chen's harder-edged approach and later experiencing conflict with him can be reconciled by understanding the different contexts of his service. Beijing likely appreciated Chen's tough stance when it was directed toward governing challenging regions like Xinjiang, where a firm hand might be seen as necessary. However, when that same assertive approach was turned toward defending Shanghai's interests against central government oversight, it became problematic from Beijing's perspective. The central government would naturally view attempts to increase regional autonomy as a challenge to its authority, even from an official it had previously favored.\n\nThis dynamic illustrates the delicate balance Chinese officials must maintain between demonstrating strong local leadership and remaining subordinate to central government authority.
