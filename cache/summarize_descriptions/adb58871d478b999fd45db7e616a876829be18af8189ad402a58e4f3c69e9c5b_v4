The organization has served as both a training ground for future political leaders and a vehicle for promoting party ideology among young people.\n\nHistorically, the Communist Youth League has deep roots in China's revolutionary period. Xi Zhongxun, father of current Chinese leader Xi Jinping, joined the organization in 1926 at the age of twelve after encountering Marxism in school, demonstrating the League's early role in recruiting and indoctrinating youth into communist ideology.\n\nThe organization has been instrumental in shaping the careers of prominent Chinese political figures. Li Keqiang worked within the Communist Youth League alongside Hu Jintao, and members from this organization formed what became known as the \"tuanpai\" or league faction within the broader Communist Party structure. This faction has represented an important power base within Chinese politics.\n\nThe League's membership process has historically been selective and sometimes politically influenced. Notably, Xi Jinping himself applied to join the Communist Youth League eight times before finally being admitted in 1972. In one documented case, the organization rejected a Bayi student's application because his father was allegedly associated with Xi Zhongxun, illustrating how political associations could impact membership decisions.\n\nIn the contemporary era, the Communist Youth League has evolved to become a major force in digital media and online activism. As the party's youth wing, it has transformed into a leading purveyor of patriotic content, producing videos for tens of millions of followers on China's most popular streaming platforms. The organization has actively engaged in internet content promotion, leveraging social media to spread nationalist messaging and mobilize young people around party-approved causes.\n\nThe League's influence extends to coordinating political campaigns and boycotts. Its official Weibo account (China's equivalent to Twitter) played a significant role in amplifying boycott campaigns against the Swedish clothing retailer H&M, demonstrating the organization's capacity to mobilize public opinion and direct consumer behavior in support of political objectives.\n\nThrough its various activities—from traditional membership recruitment and political training to modern digital activism and consumer boycott campaigns—the Communist Youth League continues to serve as a crucial instrument for the Chinese Communist Party in maintaining ideological control over youth, cultivating future political leaders, and promoting nationalist sentiment in the digital age.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"citations": null, "thinking_blocks": null}}}], "created": 1769998177, "model": "claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 518, "prompt_tokens": 367, "total_tokens": 885, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": null, "audio_tokens": null, "reasoning_tokens": null, "rejected_prediction_tokens": null, "text_tokens": 518}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null, "cache_creation_tokens": 0, "cache_creation_token_details": {"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens": 0, "ephemeral_1h_input_tokens": 0}}, "cache_creation_input_tokens": 0, "cache_read_input_tokens": 0}, "formatted_response": null, "content": "# Communist Youth League - Comprehensive Summary\n\nThe Communist Youth League is a youth organization affiliated with the Communist Party of China that has played a significant role in Chinese political life for nearly a century.
