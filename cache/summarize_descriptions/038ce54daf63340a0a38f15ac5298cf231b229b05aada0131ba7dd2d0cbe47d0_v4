He became party chief in 2012, leading the party's seven-man leadership, and has since reshaped the Communist Party according to his vision. In 2022, Xi secured a third term as party chief, further consolidating his position as the party's top leader.\n\n## Governance and Power Consolidation\n\nXi Jinping governs through the Communist Party, which he calls an indispensable instrument of governance. Throughout his tenure, he has systematically centralized power around himself, enforcing centralized authority and ideological discipline across the party. His core political objective has been strengthening the Communist Party's dominance through state enterprises and ensuring the party's authoritarian grip on power. Xi centralized diplomatic decision-making through Communist Party commissions that he chairs and seeks to ensure law enforcement forces remain loyal to the party.\n\n## Anti-Corruption Campaigns and Party Reform\n\nFighting corruption has been a central priority of Xi's leadership. He has spearheaded extensive anti-corruption campaigns, which critics suggest have also served to accrue personal power and eliminate political rivals. Xi has led efforts to cleanse and reform the Communist Party, ordering a nationwide audit to weed out unworthy members and retain only those committed to his cause. He demands unstinting loyalty from party members and has implemented policies to consolidate power throughout the organization.\n\n## Ideological Control and Historical Narratives\n\nXi has enforced the Communist Party's control over historical narratives, ordering national campaigns to study party history ahead of the party's centenary. He spoke at the party's 100th anniversary, emphasizing its significance. In 2017, Xi rewrote the party charter to include \"Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era,\" cementing his ideological influence. He has told educators to ensure students love and support the Chinese Communist Party, demonstrating his focus on ideological indoctrination.\n\n## Domestic and International Policies\n\nXi's rule has strengthened the use of law as a lever of state power, with his policies implemented across China. His top-down governance style has reportedly driven party officials toward formalism and bureaucratism. He promoted the \"China Dream\" and oversaw Hong Kong reforms, while also ordering pacification campaigns to maintain control.\n\nInternationally, Xi wants diplomats to enforce Communist Party narratives and reshape the global order in service of Communist Party rule. He has encouraged rallying the Chinese diaspora behind Beijing's interests, extending the party's influence beyond China's borders.\n\n## Taiwan Policy\n\nXi set Taiwan policy and would make the final decision on whether to use force against Taiwan. He seeks to cement his legacy through achieving what the party considers its sacred mission of unification with Taiwan, making this a key priority of his leadership.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"citations": null, "thinking_blocks": null}}}], "created": 1769998490, "model": "claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 635, "prompt_tokens": 992, "total_tokens": 1627, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": null, "audio_tokens": null, "reasoning_tokens": null, "rejected_prediction_tokens": null, "text_tokens": 635}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null, "cache_creation_tokens": 0, "cache_creation_token_details": {"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens": 0, "ephemeral_1h_input_tokens": 0}}, "cache_creation_input_tokens": 0, "cache_read_input_tokens": 0}, "formatted_response": null, "content": "# Comprehensive Summary: Xi Jinping and the Communist Party\n\nXi Jinping serves as the General Secretary of the Communist Party's Central Committee, the highest office in the party, and is the paramount leader of China's Communist Party.
