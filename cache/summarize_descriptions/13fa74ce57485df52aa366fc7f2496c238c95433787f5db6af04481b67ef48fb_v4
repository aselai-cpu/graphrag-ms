His approach to Taiwan has been characterized by increasingly aggressive pressure tactics across multiple domains.\n\nXi Jinping's familiarity with Taiwan issues dates back to his time serving in Fujian province, which is geographically separated from Taiwan by only a narrow strait. This early exposure provided him with direct insight into cross-strait relations and the complexities of the Taiwan situation.\n\nAs China's paramount leader, Xi Jinping holds the ultimate authority to decide whether China uses military force against Taiwan, making his policies and military considerations regarding the island critically important to regional stability. His approach has demonstrated growing impatience about achieving unification, moving beyond diplomatic rhetoric to concrete pressure campaigns.\n\nXi's strategy toward Taiwan has been multifaceted, employing military, diplomatic, and economic tools simultaneously. On the military front, he has authorized increased harassment of Taiwan's armed forces, including frequent incursions into Taiwan's air defense identification zone and military exercises designed to intimidate. These military considerations reflect a willingness to keep the threat of force as a viable option.\n\nDiplomatically, Xi has worked systematically to isolate Taiwan on the international stage by poaching its diplomatic partners, reducing the number of countries that maintain official relations with Taiwan. This diplomatic pressure campaign aims to demonstrate Taiwan's international vulnerability and dependence on eventual accommodation with Beijing.\n\nEconomically, Xi has implemented restrictions on trade and travel links between mainland China and Taiwan, using economic leverage as a coercive tool. Simultaneously, he has pursued a more targeted approach by courting ethnic Chinese entrepreneurs in Taiwan, attempting to create business constituencies favorable to unification while driving a wedge between Taiwan's business community and its political leadership.\n\nXi has been particularly vocal in denouncing Taiwan's president for allegedly attempting to split the motherland, framing Taiwan's democratic governance and assertions of separate identity as illegitimate separatism. This rhetorical stance has accompanied his heightened pressure campaign on unification, signaling that the status quo is increasingly unacceptable to Beijing under his leadership.\n\nOverall, Xi Jinping's Taiwan policy represents a significant escalation in cross-strait tensions, combining his personal authority, historical familiarity with the issue, and comprehensive application of pressure across military, diplomatic, and economic dimensions. His integration of Taiwan unification into his signature China Dream vision suggests this issue will remain a defining priority throughout his tenure, with potentially significant implications for regional peace and stability.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"citations": null, "thinking_blocks": null}}}], "created": 1769998559, "model": "claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 561, "prompt_tokens": 341, "total_tokens": 902, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": null, "audio_tokens": null, "reasoning_tokens": null, "rejected_prediction_tokens": null, "text_tokens": 561}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null, "cache_creation_tokens": 0, "cache_creation_token_details": {"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens": 0, "ephemeral_1h_input_tokens": 0}}, "cache_creation_input_tokens": 0, "cache_read_input_tokens": 0}, "formatted_response": null, "content": "# Comprehensive Summary: Xi Jinping and Taiwan\n\nXi Jinping, as China's leader, has made Taiwan unification a central priority of his political agenda, viewing it as an essential component of his broader \"China Dream\" and national rejuvenation vision.
