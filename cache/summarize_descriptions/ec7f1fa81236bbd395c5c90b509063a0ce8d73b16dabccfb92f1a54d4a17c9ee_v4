This early coverage highlighted his commitment to fighting corruption, a theme that would become central to his later political platform.\n\n**Contemporary Media Presence**\n\nIn more recent years, Xi Jinping's presence in People's Daily has reached unprecedented levels. His name and image are prominently featured across the newspaper's front pages as part of state media propaganda efforts. The frequency of Xi Jinping's appearances in People's Daily has been noted as unseen since the era of Mao Zedong, indicating the exceptional prominence given to his leadership and the centralization of political messaging around his persona.\n\n**Published Content**\n\nPeople's Daily serves as a primary platform for disseminating Xi Jinping's speeches and official communications. The newspaper has published multiple significant pieces featuring Xi, including his speeches on various topics and his joint interviews with BRICS media. Specifically, People's Daily has published interviews with Xi Jinping discussing BRICS countries, reflecting China's engagement with this important international coalition of emerging economies (Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa).\n\n**Significance**\n\nThe extensive coverage of Xi Jinping in People's Daily reflects the newspaper's role as the official organ of the Chinese Communist Party's Central Committee. The publication serves as a crucial vehicle for promoting Xi's political agenda, leadership image, and policy initiatives both domestically and internationally. The comparison to Mao-era coverage patterns suggests a deliberate strategy to elevate Xi's political stature and consolidate his position within China's political hierarchy.\n\nThis relationship between Xi Jinping and People's Daily demonstrates the continued importance of traditional state media in China's political system, even in the digital age, and illustrates how official publications are utilized to shape public perception of leadership and communicate party priorities to both domestic and international audiences.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"citations": null, "thinking_blocks": null}}}], "created": 1769998528, "model": "claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 481, "prompt_tokens": 288, "total_tokens": 769, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": null, "audio_tokens": null, "reasoning_tokens": null, "rejected_prediction_tokens": null, "text_tokens": 481}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null, "cache_creation_tokens": 0, "cache_creation_token_details": {"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens": 0, "ephemeral_1h_input_tokens": 0}}, "cache_creation_input_tokens": 0, "cache_read_input_tokens": 0}, "formatted_response": null, "content": "# Comprehensive Summary: Xi Jinping and People's Daily\n\nXi Jinping and People's Daily share a significant and extensively documented relationship that spans decades and reflects the evolution of China's political communication landscape.\n\n**Historical Coverage**\n\nThe relationship between Xi Jinping and People's Daily dates back to at least May 1990, when the newspaper published a report praising Xi's anti-corruption efforts in Ningde, an area where he served in a leadership capacity early in his political career.
