In 1969, during the Cultural Revolution, Xi Jinping was assigned to Liangjiahe as part of the rustication movement that sent urban youth to rural areas. He spent seven years in this village, an experience that would later become central to his political narrative.\n\nDuring his time in Liangjiahe, Xi Jinping served as village secretary, demonstrating early leadership qualities. In this role, he led efforts to build infrastructure and improve conditions in the village, gaining practical experience in governance and rural development. These formative years in Liangjiahe are associated with Xi Jinping's early experiences and the development of his initial aspirations, shaping his understanding of rural China and the challenges faced by ordinary Chinese citizens.\n\nThe significance of Liangjiahe has been amplified in contemporary China under Xi Jinping's leadership. The village has been transformed into a red tourism destination, serving as a pilgrimage site that celebrates Xi's connection to grassroots China and his humble beginnings. State media has extensively featured Liangjiahe in propaganda efforts, using Xi's time there to construct a narrative of a leader who understands the struggles of common people through direct experience. This narrative emphasizes his seven years of hardship and service in the village as evidence of his dedication to the Chinese people and his qualification for leadership.\n\nThe relationship between Xi Jinping and Liangjiahe thus operates on multiple levels: it represents a genuine biographical chapter from his youth during the Cultural Revolution, a formative period that influenced his political development, and a carefully cultivated symbol in contemporary Chinese political culture that reinforces his legitimacy and connection to the masses. The village serves both as a historical site where Xi gained practical leadership experience and as a modern propaganda tool that supports his political image and authority.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"citations": null, "thinking_blocks": null}}}], "created": 1769998544, "model": "claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 434, "prompt_tokens": 312, "total_tokens": 746, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": null, "audio_tokens": null, "reasoning_tokens": null, "rejected_prediction_tokens": null, "text_tokens": 434}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null, "cache_creation_tokens": 0, "cache_creation_token_details": {"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens": 0, "ephemeral_1h_input_tokens": 0}}, "cache_creation_input_tokens": 0, "cache_read_input_tokens": 0}, "formatted_response": null, "content": "# Comprehensive Summary: Xi Jinping and Liangjiahe\n\nXi Jinping has a significant historical connection to Liangjiahe, a village that played a formative role in his early life and political development.
