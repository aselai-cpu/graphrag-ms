This tit-for-tat detention created a serious diplomatic crisis between the two nations, highlighting the fragile nature of their relationship and raising concerns about the use of arbitrary detention as a political tool in international disputes.\n\nThe tensions were further exacerbated during a visit by Chinese diplomat Wang to Canada, where a confrontational exchange occurred with Canadian media. This incident underscored the communication challenges and differing expectations regarding press freedom and diplomatic protocol between the two countries. The contentious nature of this media interaction reflected the broader difficulties in maintaining constructive dialogue amid escalating bilateral tensions.\n\nAdding to the diplomatic friction, the Chinese ambassador to Canada made controversial statements accusing Canadian hosts of \"white supremacy.\" This serious accusation introduced a racial dimension to the diplomatic discourse and represented a significant escalation in rhetoric.
