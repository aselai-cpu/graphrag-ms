He served as Singapore's deputy prime minister before ascending to the position of premier in 2004, a role in which he has remained a prominent figure in Southeast Asian politics.\n\nAs Prime Minister, Lee Hsien Loong has been an active voice on regional and international affairs. He has delivered multiple National Day Rally speeches, including notable addresses in 2004 and 2016, which are important annual events where Singapore's leader outlines the nation's direction and policies. Beyond domestic leadership, he has contributed to international discourse on major geopolitical issues, notably writing about U.S.-China relations in the prestigious publication Foreign Affairs, where he addressed the complex dynamics between America and China.\n\nLee Hsien Loong has demonstrated a willingness to take positions on contentious regional issues, particularly regarding the South China Sea disputes. In 2016, he was outspoken in urging compliance with the Hague tribunal ruling on the South China Sea, a stance that reflected Singapore's commitment to international law and rules-based order in the region.\n\nHis diplomatic activities have occasionally generated tension with Beijing. Most notably, in 2004, while still serving as deputy prime minister and before officially becoming premier, Lee made a private trip to Taiwan. This visit sparked criticism from Beijing, as China considers Taiwan a sensitive issue and typically objects to high-level visits by foreign officials to the island. This incident highlighted the delicate balance Singapore must maintain in its relationships with both China and Taiwan, as well as Lee's willingness to engage with Taiwan despite potential diplomatic complications.\n\nThroughout his tenure, Lee Hsien Loong has positioned Singapore as an important voice in regional affairs while navigating the complex geopolitical landscape of Asia-Pacific relations. His leadership has been characterized by engagement with major powers, advocacy for international norms, and a pragmatic approach to Singapore's foreign policy interests in an increasingly multipolar world.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"citations": null, "thinking_blocks": null}}}], "created": 1769998382, "model": "claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 435, "prompt_tokens": 328, "total_tokens": 763, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": null, "audio_tokens": null, "reasoning_tokens": null, "rejected_prediction_tokens": null, "text_tokens": 435}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null, "cache_creation_tokens": 0, "cache_creation_token_details": {"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens": 0, "ephemeral_1h_input_tokens": 0}}, "cache_creation_input_tokens": 0, "cache_read_input_tokens": 0}, "formatted_response": null, "content": "# Lee Hsien Loong\n\nLee Hsien Loong is the Prime Minister of Singapore who has played a significant role in the nation's leadership and regional diplomacy.
