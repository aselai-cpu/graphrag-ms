This congress marked a watershed moment in Xi Jinping's consolidation of power and represented a departure from established leadership transition practices.\n\nOne of the most notable features of the 2017 Party Congress was the extraordinary turnover in military leadership. Nearly 90 percent of the People's Liberation Army (PLA) delegation attending the congress were first-time participants, representing a thorough and comprehensive transformation of the military brass. This unprecedented level of change in military representation indicated a major reshuffling of the PLA's senior leadership structure.\n\nEqually significant was Xi Jinping's decision regarding political succession. At this congress, Xi declined to elevate a potential successor into the Politburo Standing Committee, China's highest decision-making body. This decision was particularly noteworthy as it broke with the established pattern of leadership succession that had been followed in previous decades. Traditionally, Chinese leaders had used party congresses to signal their chosen successors by promoting younger officials to the Standing Committee, preparing them to assume leadership at the end of the incumbent's ten-year term.\n\nXi Jinping's choice not to follow this precedent at the 2017 Party Congress served as the first clear indication that he was preparing to retain power beyond the conventional ten-year leadership cycle. This move foreshadowed his subsequent elimination of presidential term limits and his continuation in power beyond what would have been the expected conclusion of his tenure.\n\nThe 2017 Party Congress thus represented a critical juncture in contemporary Chinese politics, characterized by both the extensive renewal of military leadership and the beginning of Xi Jinping's break from established succession norms. These developments collectively signaled a new era of centralized power and marked a significant departure from the collective leadership model and predictable succession planning that had characterized Chinese politics in the post-Deng Xiaoping era.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"citations": null, "thinking_blocks": null}}}], "created": 1769998347, "model": "claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 427, "prompt_tokens": 241, "total_tokens": 668, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": null, "audio_tokens": null, "reasoning_tokens": null, "rejected_prediction_tokens": null, "text_tokens": 427}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null, "cache_creation_tokens": 0, "cache_creation_token_details": {"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens": 0, "ephemeral_1h_input_tokens": 0}}, "cache_creation_input_tokens": 0, "cache_read_input_tokens": 0}, "formatted_response": null, "content": "# 2017 Party Congress\n\nThe 2017 Party Congress was a pivotal political event in China that signaled significant shifts in both military leadership and the country's political succession norms.
