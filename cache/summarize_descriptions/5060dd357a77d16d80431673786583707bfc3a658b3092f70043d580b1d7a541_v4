During her first term, she faced numerous obstacles on the international stage, including blocked participation in UN agencies and the loss of diplomatic recognition for Taiwan. Domestically, her administration encountered difficulties with controversial pension and labor reforms, which contributed to political setbacks. These challenges culminated in her resignation as chair of the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) in 2018.\n\nDespite these early setbacks, Tsai demonstrated remarkable political resilience and was re-elected in 2020 with overwhelming support, securing a record 8.17 million votes and capturing 57 percent of the vote. This historic victory represented a strong mandate from the Taiwanese people and validated her leadership approach.\n\nIn her subsequent term, President Tsai has focused significantly on Taiwan's defense capabilities and national security. She has committed to purchasing arms specifically designed for an asymmetric warfare strategy, reflecting a pragmatic approach to Taiwan's defense needs in the face of regional security challenges. This strategy emphasizes leveraging Taiwan's advantages through cost-effective, mobile, and resilient defense systems rather than attempting to match potential adversaries in conventional military capabilities.\n\nAdditionally, President Tsai announced a significant policy change regarding Taiwan's military readiness by extending mandatory military service from four months to one year, with this extension set to begin in 2024. This decision represents a substantial commitment to strengthening Taiwan's defense posture and ensuring that the nation maintains adequate military preparedness. The extension of military service reflects growing concerns about regional security and the need for a well-trained citizen defense force.\n\nThroughout her presidency, Tsai has balanced the complex demands of maintaining Taiwan's de facto independence while managing relations with both mainland China and international partners, particularly the United States. Her leadership has been characterized by a steady approach to governance, emphasizing democratic values, economic development, and national security. Despite facing significant pressure and setbacks, particularly during her first term, her record-breaking re-election victory demonstrated strong public support for her policies and leadership style, positioning her as a significant figure in Taiwan's modern political history.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"citations": null, "thinking_blocks": null}}}], "created": 1769998345, "model": "claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 460, "prompt_tokens": 268, "total_tokens": 728, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": null, "audio_tokens": null, "reasoning_tokens": null, "rejected_prediction_tokens": null, "text_tokens": 460}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null, "cache_creation_tokens": 0, "cache_creation_token_details": {"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens": 0, "ephemeral_1h_input_tokens": 0}}, "cache_creation_input_tokens": 0, "cache_read_input_tokens": 0}, "formatted_response": null, "content": "# TSAI - President of Taiwan\n\nTsai is the President of Taiwan who has navigated significant domestic and international challenges throughout her tenure.
