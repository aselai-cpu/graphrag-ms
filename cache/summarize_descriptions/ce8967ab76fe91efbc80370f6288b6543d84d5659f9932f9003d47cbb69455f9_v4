In 1950, MacArthur wrote a memorandum on Formosa that outlined his strategic assessment of the island's importance to American interests in the Pacific region.\n\nMacArthur famously described Taiwan as an \"unsinkable aircraft carrier\" that could project power throughout the region. This characterization reflected his understanding of Taiwan's geographic position and its potential strategic value to the United States and its allies. Located off the coast of mainland China, Taiwan occupied a critical position in what would become known as the \"first island chain\" in the Western Pacific. MacArthur's metaphor emphasized that the island could serve as a permanent, stationary platform for military operations, surveillance, and power projection—advantages that a traditional aircraft carrier possessed but with the added benefit of being immovable and thus able to maintain a constant strategic presence.\n\nThis assessment came during a pivotal moment in Asian geopolitics, as the Chinese Civil War had recently concluded with the Communist victory on the mainland in 1949, and the Nationalist government under Chiang Kai-shek had retreated to Taiwan. MacArthur's 1950 memorandum was written in the context of these dramatic changes and the emerging tensions that would soon escalate into the Korean War, which began in June of that year.\n\nMacArthur's strategic vision of Taiwan would influence American policy debates about the island's role in containing communist expansion in Asia. His characterization of Taiwan as an unsinkable aircraft carrier underscored the island's potential importance not only for defending Taiwan itself but also for maintaining American influence and military capability throughout the broader Pacific theater.
