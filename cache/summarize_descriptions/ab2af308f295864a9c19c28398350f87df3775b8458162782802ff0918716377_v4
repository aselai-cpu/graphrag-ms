This suggests that McGregor has been tracking the controversial aspects of Xi's rule and the reactions from various quarters, whether domestic or international.\n\nSignificantly, McGregor has observed a fundamental shift in the Chinese Communist Party's approach to governance under Xi Jinping's leadership. McGregor had previously noted that the Party maintained a low profile in its operations and public presence. However, he has acknowledged that this characterization no longer holds true in the Xi Jinping era.

His leadership has fundamentally altered the Chinese Communist Party's public profile and operational style, moving away from the low-profile approach that characterized earlier periods. Xi's tenure has also generated sufficient controversy to produce a backlash, suggesting that his consolidation of power, policy directions, or governance methods have proven contentious.\n\nThrough McGregor's work, we understand that Xi Jinping's leadership represents a pivotal period in Chinese politics—one that has changed the Party's relationship with visibility and power, generated opposition, and raised important questions about what will follow after his era concludes.
