Throughout his tenure, Liu Xiaoming was notably vocal in his support of this assertive diplomatic style, which marked a significant shift in China's international engagement strategy.\n\nAs a key proponent of Wolf Warrior diplomacy, Liu Xiaoming actively defended this confrontational approach by arguing that it was a necessary response to global realities. He famously justified the strategy by stating that \"wolves exist in the world,\" suggesting that China needed to adopt a more aggressive stance to protect its interests in the face of international challenges and criticism. This metaphorical defense became emblematic of his diplomatic philosophy during his time in Britain.\n\nLiu Xiaoming not only defended Wolf Warrior diplomacy in principle but also encouraged Chinese diplomats to embody this approach in their work. He advocated for diplomats to take initiative and actively \"fight\" when representing China's interests abroad, promoting a more combative and assertive posture compared to China's traditionally reserved diplomatic style. This encouragement reflected a broader shift in Chinese foreign policy during his ambassadorship, as Beijing moved away from Deng Xiaoping's earlier counsel to \"hide capabilities and bide time\" toward a more openly assertive international presence.\n\nDuring his eleven-year tenure as ambassador, Liu Xiaoming became one of the most visible Chinese diplomats in the Western world, frequently engaging with British media, politicians, and public figures. His ambassadorship coincided with increasingly complex China-UK relations, marked by tensions over issues including human rights, Hong Kong, Huawei's involvement in British telecommunications infrastructure, and broader geopolitical competition between China and Western nations.\n\nLiu Xiaoming's defense and promotion of Wolf Warrior diplomacy made him a controversial but significant figure in contemporary Chinese foreign relations, representing a generation of Chinese diplomats willing to publicly challenge criticism of China and assertively promote Beijing's positions on contentious international issues.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"citations": null, "thinking_blocks": null}}}], "created": 1769998368, "model": "claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 443, "prompt_tokens": 235, "total_tokens": 678, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": null, "audio_tokens": null, "reasoning_tokens": null, "rejected_prediction_tokens": null, "text_tokens": 443}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null, "cache_creation_tokens": 0, "cache_creation_token_details": {"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens": 0, "ephemeral_1h_input_tokens": 0}}, "cache_creation_input_tokens": 0, "cache_read_input_tokens": 0}, "formatted_response": null, "content": "# Liu Xiaoming\n\nLiu Xiaoming served as China's Ambassador to Britain from 2010 to 2021, during which time he became a prominent figure in defending and exemplifying China's \"Wolf Warrior diplomacy\" approach.
