His departure from office was particularly noteworthy as he abided by the term limits he had established, thereby ending fifty-five years of continuous Kuomintang (KMT) rule in Taiwan. This peaceful transition of power marked a pivotal moment in Taiwan's democratic development and demonstrated Lee's commitment to democratic principles and institutional reform.\n\nBeyond his role as president, Lee has been an influential voice in defense and strategic matters affecting Taiwan and the broader Asian region. His defense ideas have had a notable impact on Taiwan's military strategy, shaping how the nation approaches its security challenges. However, his strategic concepts have not been universally embraced; some members of Taiwan's defense establishment have remained resistant to his ideas, suggesting ongoing debates within Taiwan's military and security circles about the best approach to national defense.\n\nLee has also demonstrated engagement with broader geopolitical issues, particularly regarding the critical relationship between the United States and China. He has commented on the importance of U.S.-China relations for shaping the Asian century, recognizing that the dynamic between these two major powers will be crucial in determining the region's future trajectory. This perspective reflects Lee's understanding of Taiwan's position within the larger context of great power competition and regional stability in Asia.\n\nLee's legacy encompasses both his concrete political achievements—particularly the democratic transition he facilitated—and his ongoing intellectual contributions to discussions about Taiwan's defense posture and the geopolitical landscape of Asia. His willingness to relinquish power according to constitutional limits set an important precedent for Taiwan's democracy, while his continued engagement with strategic issues demonstrates his lasting influence on Taiwan's policy debates.
