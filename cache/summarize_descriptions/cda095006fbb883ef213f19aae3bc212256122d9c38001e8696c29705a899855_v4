Growing up in Beijing, Xi roamed its streets during the Cultural Revolution, experiencing firsthand the tumultuous political atmosphere of that era.\n\nXi's early life in Beijing was interrupted when he left the capital in January 1969 to escape persecution and join the rustication movement, a departure that would prove formative for his political development. After spending three years as a military aide in Beijing, Xi made a strategic career choice to leave his desk job in the capital and enter grassroots politics in the 1980s, spending approximately a quarter century working in local government across China's provinces. During his time leading Ningde, Xi notably never returned to Beijing to solicit projects, defying the expectations of local officials. His provincial experience included overseeing preparations for the Olympics in Beijing and later working at the Central Party School there, before being transferred back to Beijing following his tenure in Shanghai.\n\nXi's ascension to China's top leadership position occurred in 2012 when he became general secretary, and he was formally crowned president in Beijing in spring 2018. His first trip outside Beijing as general secretary in 2012 was carefully orchestrated to demonstrate his leadership style. In 2013, he visited a steamed bun shop in Beijing that subsequently became a viral sensation, showcasing his populist approach.\n\nAs China's paramount leader, Xi Jinping leads from Beijing, directing the central government's policy-making and economic supervision. He presides over the political elite who gather in the capital for legislative sessions and addressed the Communist Party elite assembled in Beijing in January 2021. His leadership has been marked by significant policy shifts, including changes in Beijing's ethnic affairs approach that coincided with his 2012 accession. Xi has also echoed the Beijing party leadership in denouncing Taiwan's president and applied pressure on Taiwan from his position in the capital.\n\nThroughout his career, Xi's trajectory has been influenced by decisions made by party conservatives and elders in Beijing. He has given lectures to county party secretaries in the capital and presided over major national events, including the 2015 military parade at Tiananmen. However, his leadership has not been without criticism; his limited education was reportedly criticized at a Beijing hotel gathering in 2013.\n\nAs China's top leader, Xi Jinping continues to lead the Chinese government from Beijing, setting the policy direction for the nation and maintaining the capital's position as the center of political power in China.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"citations": null, "thinking_blocks": null}}}], "created": 1769998504, "model": "claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 567, "prompt_tokens": 713, "total_tokens": 1280, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": null, "audio_tokens": null, "reasoning_tokens": null, "rejected_prediction_tokens": null, "text_tokens": 567}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null, "cache_creation_tokens": 0, "cache_creation_token_details": {"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens": 0, "ephemeral_1h_input_tokens": 0}}, "cache_creation_input_tokens": 0, "cache_read_input_tokens": 0}, "formatted_response": null, "content": "# Comprehensive Summary: Xi Jinping and Beijing\n\nXi Jinping, born in Beijing on June 15, 1953, has maintained a lifelong connection with China's capital city that has profoundly shaped his political career and leadership.
