This collapse has been extensively studied by scholars, including Joseph Torigian, who examined Soviet power struggles and succession dynamics alongside similar processes in China, contributing to comparative studies of authoritarian resilience and leadership transition.\n\nThe Soviet Union's relationship with China was complex and evolved significantly over time. Initially, the Soviet Union served as a fellow communist state that provided guidance to Chinese diplomats on protocol and embassy work during the early years of the People's Republic. However, the relationship deteriorated during the post-Stalin era, leading to a split between Beijing and Moscow. This deterioration was particularly notable after Khrushchev denounced Stalin in 1956, marking a turning point in Sino-Soviet relations. The tensions became so severe that Beijing sought to develop bilateral military links with Washington as a counterweight to Soviet power. China strategically avoided bitter quarrels with the Soviet Union by giving up certain territorial claims.\n\nDuring the Cold War, the Soviet Union tested Singapore's neutrality by sending ships for repairs, demonstrating its global reach and influence. The Soviet Union also backed the second East Turkestan republic during the 1940s, playing a significant role in Central Asian geopolitics.\n\nThe Soviet Union features prominently in Chinese political discourse and lessons about governance. Xi Jinping has repeatedly referenced the Soviet collapse as a cautionary tale for the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). According to Xi's analysis, the Soviet Union was brought down by \"historical nihilism\" and the betrayal of individuals who abandoned the communist cause—a narrative promoted in documentaries that party cadres were required to watch. Xi blames the Soviet collapse partly on bungled successions that allowed weak leaders to rise to power, particularly citing the period after Stalin's death in 1953, which triggered succession jockeying among the leadership, and the tenure of Mikhail Gorbachev, who led the country before the August 1991 coup attempt.
