Notably, his initial entry into this important party body was inauspicious—he ranked dead last among the 151 alternates chosen that year. This humble beginning within the Central Committee hierarchy would prove to be just the starting point of a remarkable political ascent.\n\nDespite this modest start, Xi eventually rose through the party ranks to achieve the organization's most powerful position. According to party charter procedures, the Central Committee selected Xi as general secretary, the top leadership position within the Communist Party of China. This selection followed the established institutional protocols outlined in the party's governing documents, demonstrating adherence to formal organizational processes even as power dynamics shifted.\n\nIn his role as general secretary, Xi works through the Central Committee as the primary institutional mechanism to implement policies and centralize power. The Central Committee serves as the key organizational vehicle through which Xi exercises authority and advances his political agenda. This working relationship reflects the institutional structure of the Communist Party, where the general secretary operates through the Central Committee to execute decisions and consolidate control over party operations and governance.\n\nThe trajectory from being the lowest-ranked alternate member in 1997 to becoming general secretary and utilizing the Central Committee as an instrument for policy implementation and power centralization illustrates Xi's significant political evolution within the party structure.
