His presidency marked a significant shift in Philippine foreign policy, particularly regarding the country's relationship with China and its approach to territorial disputes in the South China Sea.\n\nOne of the most notable aspects of Duterte's foreign policy was his dramatic reversal of the Philippines' stance on arbitration against China. Despite the Philippines winning a landmark case at the Hague tribunal regarding territorial disputes in the South China Sea, Duterte dismissed the ruling and chose not to enforce it against China.

Instead of maintaining a confrontational stance based on international law and the arbitration ruling, Duterte pivoted toward a more conciliatory relationship with Beijing. His strategy focused on seeking Chinese investment and economic cooperation, prioritizing economic benefits over the enforcement of the Philippines' legal rights in the disputed waters.\n\nDuterte's approach reflected his broader foreign policy philosophy of pursuing closer ties with China while distancing the Philippines somewhat from its traditional alliance with the United States.
