The protests were sparked by mourning following the death of Hu Yaobang in April 1989, a reformist leader whose passing catalyzed widespread public discontent.\n\nAt their peak, as many as a million people rallied in Tiananmen Square to demand greater political freedoms. The movement was centered around public anger over inflation and corruption, and it inspired similar demonstrations across the country, including in Fujian province. The protests drew support from Hong Kongers and represented a broad-based challenge to Communist Party authority.\n\nThe demonstrations were crushed with deadly force on June 4, 1989, in what became known as the June 4 massacre. Deng Xiaoping ordered military force to suppress the protests, with the People's Liberation Army (PLA) violently clearing the square. The crackdown resulted in significant casualties and led to immediate international condemnation, with the United States and European nations imposing sanctions against Beijing. This event previously represented the highest levels of global anti-China sentiment.\n\nThe protests and their suppression had profound and lasting political implications for China. The events were characterized by the Communist Party as counter-revolutionary riots, and the crackdown was viewed as a near-death experience for the Party that intensified its focus on stability maintenance. Party leaders were stunned by the demonstrations, which exposed a loss of faith in Marxism-Leninism among the population and forced them to seek new ways to inspire loyalty to Communist rule.\n\nThe aftermath led to significant political changes within the Party. The protests intensified party infighting over economic reforms and resulted in purges of liberal-minded colleagues. Ideological drift worsened within the Communist Party following the events. Notably, the protests halted reforms that had previously curtailed the powers of the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection (CCDI), leading to a restoration of the Party's authority over state organs.\n\nThe crackdown also resulted in political exile for some participants and supporters, including Yan Jiaqi, who fled China following the events. Both Deng Xiaoping and later Xi Jinping responded to the legacy of these protests through various political measures aimed at preventing similar challenges to Party authority.
