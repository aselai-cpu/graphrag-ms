Throughout this extended period in Fujian, Xi Jinping actively courted ethnic Chinese entrepreneurs in Southeast Asia who had ancestral roots in the province.\n\nFujian Province has historically been a major source of Chinese emigration to Southeast Asia, and many successful ethnic Chinese business communities throughout the region trace their family origins back to this coastal province. During his time serving in various leadership positions in Fujian, Xi Jinping recognized the strategic importance of these cultural and ancestral connections. He engaged with these diaspora communities, particularly targeting entrepreneurs and business leaders whose families had originated from Fujian.\n\nThis outreach to Southeast Asian ethnic Chinese entrepreneurs represented both a cultural and economic strategy. By emphasizing shared ancestral roots and cultural heritage, Xi Jinping worked to strengthen ties between Fujian and Southeast Asian business communities. These connections would prove valuable for fostering economic relationships, encouraging investment, and building networks that bridged China and Southeast Asia.\n\nXi Jinping's seventeen years of experience in Fujian Province, from 1985 to 2002, provided him with extensive exposure to the province's unique position as a historical gateway to Southeast Asia. This experience allowed him to understand the importance of people-to-people connections and the role that cultural affinity could play in broader diplomatic and economic relationships. The ethnic Chinese communities in Southeast Asia, many of whom maintained strong cultural and familial ties to their ancestral homeland in Fujian, represented a natural bridge for building stronger China-Southeast Asia relations.\n\nThis early engagement with Southeast Asian diaspora communities during his time in Fujian would later inform Xi Jinping's approach to regional diplomacy and economic policy as he rose through China's political ranks.
