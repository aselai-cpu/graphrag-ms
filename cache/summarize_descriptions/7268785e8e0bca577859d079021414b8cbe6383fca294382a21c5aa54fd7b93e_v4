His death triggered significant political upheaval, with succession battles that fundamentally upended Soviet politics and ultimately resulted in the repudiation of despotism.\n\nFollowing Stalin's death, his successor Nikita Khrushchev took decisive action to distance the Soviet Union from Stalin's legacy.
