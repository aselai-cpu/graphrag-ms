Originally part of China, Hong Kong was ceded to Britain after the First Opium War and served as a British colony for over 150 years. During this period, it functioned as a refuge for Chinese elites fleeing Communist rule, and later attracted impoverished Chinese migrants during the 1970s and 1980s seeking better economic opportunities.\n\nHong Kong returned to Chinese rule in 1997 as a former British territory, marking a significant transition in its governance structure. Since the handover, the region has been gradually integrated into China's political system through various mechanisms, including patriotic education initiatives and security overhauls designed to strengthen Beijing's control.\n\nThe relationship between Hong Kong and mainland China reached a critical turning point in summer 2019, when the city experienced significant anti-Beijing unrest and protests. These demonstrations prompted a crackdown by authorities, and in 2020, Beijing imposed a national security law on Hong Kong that fundamentally altered the region's autonomy and freedoms. This law led to tighter Chinese state scrutiny and significantly diminished the availability of sensitive material in the territory.\n\nFollowing the 2020 national security law, Hong Kong authorities tightened press controls in alignment with mainland China's policies, resulting in deteriorating media conditions. The restrictive environment prompted several news organizations to relocate their operations elsewhere, and at least one expelled journalist fled to Hong Kong as a destination, though the city itself was experiencing its own crackdowns.\n\nHong Kong serves important economic functions for China, particularly as a location where Chinese companies list stocks. The city has listed Chinese state-owned enterprises (SOEs) that have revised their governance structures to strengthen Communist Party control. Additionally, Hong Kong was considered by DiDi as an alternative listing destination to U.S. markets, highlighting its continued role as a financial hub despite political tensions.\n\nThe region remains subject to Communist Party control and Beijing's authority, with China's political objectives influencing Hong Kong's education policies and other governmental functions. During the zero-Covid period, Chinese deterrence activities occurred in Hong Kong, further demonstrating Beijing's direct involvement in the region's affairs.
