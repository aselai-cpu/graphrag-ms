His administration implemented tariffs and trade barriers as part of an \"America First\" agenda, initiating what became known as a trade war between the world's two largest economies. Trump's protectionist stance challenged the existing multilateral trading system and questioned long-standing international economic arrangements.\n\nIn stark contrast, Xi Jinping positioned China and himself as defenders of globalization and the multilateral world order during this period. As Trump withdrew from or criticized international agreements and institutions, Xi seized the opportunity to present China as a responsible stakeholder in the global economy. He advocated for free trade, international cooperation, and the preservation of multilateral institutions, effectively casting China as a stabilizing force in international affairs. This rhetorical positioning represented a notable role reversal, with China—traditionally viewed as a developing economy seeking to protect certain domestic sectors—presenting itself as a champion of open markets, while the United States adopted more inward-looking policies.\n\nHowever, Xi Jinping's response to Trump's trade war also included significant domestic economic adjustments. Rather than pursuing market liberalization, Xi channeled resources toward China's state sector, strengthening government control over key industries and strategic economic areas. This approach reflected China's state-capitalist model, where the government maintains significant influence over the economy through state-owned enterprises and industrial policy. By reinforcing the state sector, Xi aimed to insulate China's economy from external pressures and ensure that strategic industries remained under government control during the period of heightened trade tensions.\n\nThe dynamic between these two leaders thus highlighted a fundamental paradox: while Xi Jinping publicly championed globalization and multilateralism on the international stage, his domestic response to trade pressures involved consolidating state control over the Chinese economy. Meanwhile, Trump's protectionism represented a challenge to the post-World War II liberal international economic order that the United States had largely created and maintained.\n\nThis period marked a significant moment in global economic history, with the U.S.-China relationship evolving from one of economic integration toward strategic competition.
