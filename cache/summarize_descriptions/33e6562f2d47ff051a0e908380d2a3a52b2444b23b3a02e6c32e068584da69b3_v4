His work demonstrates a consistent focus on China's activities across multiple spheres of global governance and diplomacy.\n\nHinshaw has co-authored numerous articles examining China's involvement in international organizations, with particular attention to high-profile institutions and diplomatic matters. His reporting portfolio includes coverage of China's top law enforcement official and that official's relationship with Interpol, the international police organization. This work highlights his expertise in covering the intersection of Chinese domestic politics and international law enforcement cooperation.\n\nHis investigative journalism extends to trade and economic disputes, as evidenced by his co-reporting on the European Union taking China to the World Trade Organization (WTO). This coverage demonstrates his ability to navigate complex international trade law and diplomatic tensions between major global powers.\n\nHinshaw has also reported on sensitive diplomatic incidents, including a secret prisoner swap between the United States and China. This type of reporting requires access to confidential sources and the ability to handle sensitive information regarding bilateral relations between the world's two largest economies.\n\nAdditionally, his work has examined China's geopolitical pressure tactics, specifically reporting on China's pressure campaign against the European Union and Lithuania. This coverage illustrates his understanding of how China leverages its economic and political influence to advance its interests in regional disputes and bilateral relationships with smaller nations.\n\nFurthermore, Hinshaw has contributed to reporting on one of the most significant and politically sensitive topics of recent years: the investigation into the origins of COVID-19. His articles about China's activities related to the COVID-19 origin probe demonstrate his involvement in covering stories of global health significance and international accountability.\n\nThroughout his body of work, Drew Hinshaw has consistently collaborated with other journalists, as indicated by the multiple references to co-authoring and co-reporting articles. This collaborative approach is typical of major investigative journalism at prestigious outlets like The Wall Street Journal, where complex international stories often require multiple reporters with different areas of expertise.\n\nOverall, Drew Hinshaw has established himself as a skilled journalist specializing in China's role in international affairs, covering topics ranging from international organizations and trade disputes to diplomatic incidents and global health crises.
