She has made significant contributions to the academic understanding of how autocratic governments manage transitions of power and respond to threats against their leadership.\n\nFrantz is notably recognized as a co-author of multiple influential research papers examining various aspects of authoritarian governance. One of her key works is the article \"Countering Coups,\" which was published in June 2017. This research explores strategies that authoritarian regimes employ to prevent military coups and examines the role of leadership succession rules in dictatorships as mechanisms for maintaining regime stability.\n\nIn 2016, Frantz co-authored a significant paper titled \"When Dictators Die,\" which was published in the Journal of Democracy in October of that year. This research analyzed the consequences of authoritarian leadership changes, particularly focusing on what occurs when dictators die while in power. The study found that personalist regimes—those centered around a single dominant leader rather than a party or military institution—are particularly prone to instability following a leader's death. This finding highlights the vulnerability of highly centralized authoritarian systems that lack institutionalized succession mechanisms.\n\nAdditionally, Frantz has contributed to scholarly understanding of why autocratic leaders agree to establish succession rules in the first place. This research addresses a fundamental puzzle in authoritarian politics: why would leaders who have consolidated power voluntarily create rules that might constrain their authority or determine their replacement? Her work in this area helps explain the strategic calculations that dictators make regarding regime longevity and stability.\n\nThrough her various publications, Frantz has established herself as an expert on the internal dynamics of authoritarian regimes, particularly concerning leadership transitions, coup prevention, and institutional design in non-democratic systems. Her research provides valuable insights into how dictatorships attempt to solve the perennial problem of succession—a challenge that has historically been one of the greatest vulnerabilities of authoritarian rule.
