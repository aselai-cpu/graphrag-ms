The inclusion of his eponymous political thought in the party charter signifies the extraordinary level of influence and authority he wields within the Communist Party of China.\n\nUnder Xi Jinping's leadership, the Communist Party of China has undergone a fundamental transformation in its governance approach. He has systematically elevated the party's role in all aspects of Chinese society and government, placing it unequivocally in charge of policy-making across all domains. This represents a strengthening of party control and a reassertion of the CPC's central position in directing China's political, economic, and social affairs.\n\nXi Jinping has also emphasized the importance of narrative control and ideological communication, calling for the party to \"tell the Communist Party's stories well.\" This directive reflects his focus on shaping both domestic and international perceptions of the CPC, promoting the party's achievements, and controlling the narrative surrounding China's development and the party's role in it. This emphasis on storytelling and propaganda work demonstrates his understanding of the importance of soft power and ideological influence in maintaining party legitimacy and advancing China's interests.\n\nThe rewriting of the party charter to include \"Xi Jinping Thought\" and the consolidation of policy-making authority under party leadership represent defining features of his tenure.
