His rise to power within the party began when he seized effective control at a 1935 conference, subsequently becoming the party's top political officeholder in 1943. As a Communist Party leader and revolutionary, Mao proclaimed the People's Republic and led China during what became known as the 'standing up' epoch, having attended the inaugural party congress in 1921.\n\nMao established his dominance over the Communist Party through strategic storytelling and the 1945 resolution that praised his correct leadership. This consolidation of power made him the undisputed leader of the party, with rival officials vying for his favor in hopes of becoming his chosen heir. His leadership style was characterized by a complex relationship with the party apparatus itself—while he led the Communist Party, he simultaneously railed against bureaucracy within its ranks and frequently bypassed traditional party structures by appealing directly to the people.\n\nDuring the early years of the People's Republic, Mao implemented policies designed to mobilize support through patriotic sentiment, lionizing Communist Party heroes as part of his broader strategy to build revolutionary fervor. However, his approach to leadership was often contradictory. Despite being the party's chairman, Mao called on the people to attack what he perceived as a decaying party, demonstrating his willingness to undermine the very institution he led when he believed it necessary for revolutionary purposes.\n\nMao's rabble-rousing tactics and campaigns that appealed directly to the masses had a lasting impact on the Communist Party, influencing how party leaders tempered their rhetoric for years to come. His leadership style established a precedent of mobilizing popular movements outside traditional party channels, a approach that would have profound implications for China's political development.\n\nIn summary, Mao's relationship with the Communist Party was multifaceted: he was simultaneously its founder, its most powerful chairman, and paradoxically, one of its harshest critics. He built his authority through careful political maneuvering in the 1930s and 1940s, established the People's Republic as the party's leader, and created a unique leadership model that combined formal party authority with direct popular appeals, often at the expense of party bureaucracy itself.
