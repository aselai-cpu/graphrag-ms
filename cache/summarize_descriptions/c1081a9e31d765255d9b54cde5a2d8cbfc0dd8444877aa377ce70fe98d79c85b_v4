Through this role, Xi Jinping commands China's armed forces and exercises significant authority over the nation's military apparatus.\n\nXi Jinping was formally elected as Chairman of the Central Military Commission in March 2018, solidifying his position at the apex of military leadership. As chairman, he is closely associated with the Central Military Commission as its principal leader, wielding considerable influence over military policy and strategic decision-making.\n\nUnder Xi Jinping's leadership, the Central Military Commission has experienced significant centralization of power. Xi Jinping has centralized decision-making authority under his personal control, consolidating his influence over military affairs and reducing the autonomy of other military leaders. This centralization reflects a broader pattern of Xi Jinping's leadership style, which emphasizes concentrated authority and direct oversight.\n\nXi Jinping has also undertaken substantial personnel changes within the Central Military Commission to strengthen his control over the institution. Following the dismissal of certain generals and vice chairmen, Xi Jinping replaced these dismissed officials with his own associates and trusted allies. This strategic reshuffling of leadership positions has allowed Xi Jinping to surround himself with loyalists who support his vision and policies, further reinforcing his authority over the military establishment.\n\nThe relationship between Xi Jinping and the Central Military Commission exemplifies the integration of political and military power in China's governance structure. As chairman, Xi Jinping occupies a position that is essential not only for military command but also for maintaining overall political stability and implementing national security strategies.
