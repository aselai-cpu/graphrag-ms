Xi worked in Fujian for seventeen years, serving in various increasingly important positions throughout the 1980s, 1990s, and early 2000s. His roles in the province included vice mayor of Xiamen, party chief of Ningde, Provincial Party Standing Committee Member, deputy party chief (provincial number two), and eventually governor.

He developed a business-friendly record and actively courted ethnic Chinese entrepreneurs, contributing to the province's economic success.
