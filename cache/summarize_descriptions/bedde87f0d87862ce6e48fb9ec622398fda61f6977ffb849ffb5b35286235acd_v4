However, this relationship has been marked by substantial controversy and financial consequences stemming from political tensions between the two entities.\n\nThe NBA experienced severe financial repercussions in China following what became known as the Daryl Morey tweet controversy. Daryl Morey, then General Manager of the Houston Rockets, posted a tweet in October 2019 expressing support for Hong Kong protesters, which sparked immediate backlash from Chinese authorities, businesses, and fans. This incident triggered a major crisis in the NBA's relationship with China, resulting in the league losing hundreds of millions of dollars in sponsorship revenue from Chinese companies.\n\nThe financial losses extended beyond just sponsorship deals, as Chinese state television suspended broadcasts of NBA games, merchandise sales plummeted, and various Chinese corporate partners severed or suspended their relationships with the league. These consequences highlighted the delicate balance the NBA must maintain between its business interests in China and its values regarding freedom of expression, as well as the broader geopolitical tensions between the United States and China.\n\nDespite these significant setbacks and the political tensions that emerged from the controversy, the NBA and China have maintained some level of business relations, though the relationship has been fundamentally altered by these events. The incident served as a watershed moment, demonstrating the potential costs of political disagreements on international business partnerships and the challenges faced by American sports leagues operating in markets with different political systems and values.\n\nThe NBA-China relationship remains an important case study in international sports business, illustrating both the lucrative opportunities and significant risks associated with global expansion, particularly in politically sensitive markets.
