Historically, the Washington Post reported on significant events such as Gorbachev's ouster in August 1991 and China's political transitions. The newspaper has also published articles examining Chinese Communist Party history, including an interview with party historian Shi Zhongquan about the history writing process.\n\nIn terms of contemporary China coverage, the Washington Post has reported extensively on various sensitive topics including restrictions on freedom of thought at Chinese universities and Xinjiang's rehabilitation following government crackdowns in the region. The newspaper has also covered U.S.-China diplomatic tensions and published articles analyzing bilateral relations between the two nations.\n\nThe Washington Post itself became part of the story it was covering when it experienced direct consequences from Chinese authorities. In March 2020, the newspaper had its reporters' press credentials revoked by China, and its journalists were among those expelled from the country. This expulsion occurred during the first half of 2020, a period when multiple U.S. media organizations faced similar actions from Chinese authorities. The Washington Post notably broke the news of at least one author's expulsion from China and also reported on China's expulsion of Wall Street Journal reporters during this same period.\n\nThe publication has covered various diplomatic incidents and controversies, including reporting on a Twitter confrontation between Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian and former U.S. National Security Advisor Susan Rice. Additionally, the newspaper published M. Taylor Fravel's article discussing then-Secretary of State Mike Pompeo's criticism of China in 2020.\n\nBeyond U.S.-China relations, the Washington Post has also reported on domestic U.S. policy matters with international implications, such as coverage of the Chips Act and American industrial policy.\n\nThe newspaper is referenced in various texts with specific page citations (271-72, 273), indicating its role as a primary source for researchers and historians studying this period of international relations.
