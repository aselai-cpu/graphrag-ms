Born in July 1949 as the fourth of seven children, Bo Xilai was the son of Bo Yibo, a revolutionary hero, making him a \"princeling\"—a term used to describe the children of China's revolutionary elite.\n\nBo Xilai's political career was marked by ambition and a distinctive governing style. He served in several high-profile positions throughout his ascent, including mayor of Dalian, provincial governor of Liaoning, and commerce minister in 2004.

Just weeks before the party congress that year, he was purged from the Communist Party amid corruption and murder scandals.
