These riots represented a violent escalation of long-standing ethnic grievances between the two communities.\n\nA primary source of friction between Uyghurs and Han Chinese has been widening economic disparities. The Uyghurs, a predominantly Muslim Turkic ethnic group indigenous to Xinjiang, have experienced growing economic inequality compared to the Han Chinese population in the region. These economic disparities have contributed significantly to ethnic tensions and unrest, as Uyghurs have felt increasingly marginalized in their own homeland.
