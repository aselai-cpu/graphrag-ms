The contagion tore through China in the early months of 2020, prompting immediate and extensive government responses that would shape the country's policies for years to come.\n\nIn response to the outbreak, China implemented strict measures including closing its borders and enforcing lockdowns across the country. The government adopted a zero-Covid policy that became a defining feature of China's pandemic management approach. During the lockdowns, state-owned enterprises (SOEs) played a crucial role in helping to shore up and stabilize the Chinese economy during this period of crisis.\n\nThe pandemic became a highly sensitive political issue within China. Students were actively discouraged from portraying the government's handling of COVID-19 in unfavorable terms in their essays, reflecting the authorities' concern about public perception and criticism of their response. One notable critic was Zhou Shaoqing, who publicly criticized the government's response to the pandemic.\n\nChina's management of COVID-19 sparked significant international tensions and diplomatic challenges. Beijing's response to the pandemic led to widespread Western criticism, with particular controversy arising when French media questioned China's handling of the outbreak. These diplomatic tensions were further complicated by allegations and conspiracy theories regarding the pandemic's origins, specifically claims that COVID-19 may have originated from a laboratory.\n\nIn response to international scrutiny, Chinese President Xi Jinping directed diplomats to actively defend China's pandemic response and the efficacy of Chinese-produced vaccines. China had developed and manufactured its own COVID-19 vaccines, and their effectiveness became a matter of national pride and diplomatic importance that Xi wanted his diplomatic corps to champion on the international stage.\n\nThe pandemic resulted in significant loss of life, with deaths occurring in late 2022 and early 2023. The government's response included extensive border controls, widespread vaccination efforts using domestically produced vaccines, and the implementation of the strict zero-Covid policy.\n\n**Note:** There appears to be a data inconsistency in the provided descriptions, with one reference mentioning \"2009-2010\" as the pandemic timeframe and \"2084-86\" for the zero-Covid policy.
