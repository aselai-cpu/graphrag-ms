His era, often characterized as the \"getting rich\" epoch, was marked by optimism, opportunity, and efforts to encourage intellectual curiosity and debate within the Communist Party.\n\nAs paramount leader, Deng enacted the landmark 1981 resolution on history, which repudiated Mao Zedong's megalomania while carefully maintaining Mao's legacy. He urged the party to \"liberate thoughts\" and led sweeping market-opening reforms that welcomed outside capital into China and transformed the nation's economic trajectory. His approach to governance involved consolidating power with backing from the People's Liberation Army (PLA), and he worked to establish his authority while promoting capitalism and progressive economic policies.\n\nDeng's leadership style differed markedly from both his predecessor and successors. Unlike Mao, he and his successors avoided mobilizing the masses for political campaigns, instead relying mainly on party members to implement their initiatives. This represented a significant shift in Chinese political methodology and governance approach.\n\nHowever, Deng's legacy is complex and contradictory. While promoting openness and reform, he crushed the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests with military force, a defining and controversial moment of his leadership. Following this massacre, Deng urged patience in rehabilitating China's international image and dispensed foreign policy principles that would shape Chinese diplomacy for two decades.\n\nDeng's succession became a subject of intense interest and analysis, particularly by U.S. intelligence agencies. The CIA produced reports in 1986, including \"China After Deng: Succession Problems and Prospects,\" analyzing potential scenarios following his death and the succession challenges facing China. His successors would go on to pursue anticorruption crackdowns, though they maintained his general approach of avoiding mass mobilization.\n\nThe historical significance of Deng's leadership continues to resonate in contemporary Chinese politics. He is frequently referenced in relation to Xi Jinping, appearing in Director of Central Intelligence reports and scholarly analyses, including work by Pei Yiran. Xi's own historical resolution mentions Deng six times, highlighting his enduring importance to party history. The contrast between Deng's call to \"liberate thoughts\" and Xi's more restrictive approach illustrates evolving leadership philosophies within the Chinese Communist Party.\n\nDeng's physical legacy has also been contested—his sculpture was torn down at one point and later replaced with a new frieze, symbolizing the ongoing reappraisal of his complex historical role.
