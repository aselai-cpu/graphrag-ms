The region has become a focal point where major power interests intersect, especially concerning territorial and economic disputes in the South China Sea.\n\nThe region is characterized by significant geopolitical tensions, with five Southeast Asian nations asserting sovereignty and economic rights in the South China Sea that overlap with Beijing's territorial claims. This has made Southeast Asia a key theater for US-China strategic competition, as both powers seek to expand their influence in the area.\n\nSoutheast Asia has deep historical and cultural connections with China, particularly through the province of Fujian. Over past centuries, many Fujianese migrants settled throughout Southeast Asia, creating enduring cultural and familial ties between the region and China. These ancestral connections have been leveraged in modern diplomatic efforts, as Chinese President Xi Jinping has courted ethnic Chinese entrepreneurs in Southeast Asia who trace their roots back to Fujian, using these cultural bonds to strengthen economic and political relationships.\n\nThe region has been the site of significant diplomatic activity by Chinese leadership. Xi Jinping has conducted visits to Southeast Asian nations, including Laos, as part of China's broader engagement strategy in the region. China has established formal diplomatic relations with various Southeast Asian nations, including Singapore, demonstrating the region's importance to Chinese foreign policy objectives.\n\nSoutheast Asia's strategic significance stems not only from its large population and economic potential but also from its geographic position and the contested waters of the South China Sea.
