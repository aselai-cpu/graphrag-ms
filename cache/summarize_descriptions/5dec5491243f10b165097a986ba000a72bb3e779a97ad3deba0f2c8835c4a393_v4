In this capacity, he delivered a speech at the 2018 China Internet Media Forum, demonstrating his role in shaping discourse around digital media and internet policy in China. He has also contributed written work to People's Daily, China's most prominent state newspaper, further establishing his influence in the realm of cyberspace policy and administration.\n\n**Gao Xiang (Historian and Academic Administrator)**\n\nAnother Gao Xiang is a distinguished historian and academic leader who became the inaugural director of the Chinese Academy of History. Prior to this appointment, he was a leading historian at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences (CASS), where he established his scholarly reputation through influential works focusing on the Qing dynasty, China's last imperial dynasty that ruled from 1644 to 1912. His academic contributions have been significant in the field of Chinese historical studies.\n\nIn 2016, this Gao Xiang transitioned into a political role when he was appointed as propaganda chief in Fujian province, representing a common pattern in China where accomplished academics assume important Party positions. This appointment reflects the Chinese government's practice of drawing on intellectual expertise for ideological and propaganda work at the provincial level.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nWhile the descriptions provided reference \"Gao Xiang\" as a single entity, the distinct career trajectories and professional domains suggest these may be two different individuals sharing the same name. The first is primarily associated with internet governance and cyberspace administration at the national level, while the second has a background in historical scholarship and has held positions in both academic leadership and provincial propaganda work.
