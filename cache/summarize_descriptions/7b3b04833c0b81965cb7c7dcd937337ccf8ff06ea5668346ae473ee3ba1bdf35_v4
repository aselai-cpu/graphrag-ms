This organizational structure enables the network to maintain consistent messaging across its programming and ensure adherence to party directives.\n\nCCTV has played a significant role in producing content related to President Xi Jinping and his political narrative. In 2017, the broadcaster aired a documentary that featured old interview footage of Xi Jinping, highlighting his early experiences. The network has also produced and aired multiple programs about Xi Jinping's time in Liangjiahe, a village where he was sent during the Cultural Revolution. Specifically, in March 2017, CCTV produced content focused on Liangjiahe, contributing to the broader narrative surrounding Xi's formative years and connection to rural China.\n\nThe broadcaster serves as a key outlet for reporting on Chinese diplomatic matters and official government positions. CCTV reported on statements made by Ambassador Liu Xiaoming regarding Wolf Warrior diplomacy, a more assertive and confrontational approach to Chinese foreign policy that emerged in recent years. This coverage demonstrates CCTV's role in communicating China's diplomatic stance to both domestic and international audiences.\n\nCCTV also produces programming on sensitive political topics, including programs like \"Across the Strait,\" which is specifically designed to propagate the party's messaging on Taiwan, one of China's most critical policy issues. Additionally, the broadcaster has produced content about discipline inspection, including episodes featuring specific cases such as that of Lü Xiwen, reflecting the government's anti-corruption campaigns and internal party discipline efforts.\n\nBeyond political and news programming, CCTV has also been involved in cultural productions, including producing an adaptation of \"Dream of the Red Chamber,\" one of China's most celebrated classical novels, demonstrating the broadcaster's role in both political messaging and cultural programming.\n\nOverall, China Central Television functions as the primary state television organization in China, serving multiple purposes: disseminating official government positions, controlling news narratives, promoting party ideology, covering diplomatic affairs, and producing both political and cultural content that aligns with state objectives.
