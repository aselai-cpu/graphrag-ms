He has delivered important speeches at multiple plenary sessions of the CCDI, including the 2nd Plenary Session of the 18th Central Commission for Discipline Inspection and the Sixth Plenary Session of the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection. These speeches have served as crucial platforms for articulating his vision and directives regarding party discipline and anti-corruption efforts.\n\nUnder Xi Jinping's leadership, the CCDI has been significantly empowered to conduct extensive anti-corruption campaigns throughout China. Xi Jinping leads the overarching anti-graft campaign, while the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection serves as the implementing body that carries out these initiatives on the ground. The scale of these efforts has been substantial, with nearly 627,000 officials punished in 2021 alone, demonstrating the breadth and intensity of the anti-corruption drive under his administration.\n\nXi Jinping's discussions and pronouncements on anti-corruption and party discipline have provided the guiding framework for the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection's work. His ideological and strategic direction shapes the CCDI's priorities, methods, and targets in its enforcement activities. This guidance ensures that the commission's operations align with Xi Jinping's broader political objectives and his vision for party governance.\n\nFurthermore, under Xi Jinping's tenure, party disciplinarians within the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection have experienced growing powers and expanded authority. This enhancement of the CCDI's capabilities reflects Xi Jinping's commitment to strengthening internal party discipline mechanisms and his determination to combat corruption at all levels of the Chinese Communist Party and government.\n\nThe relationship between Xi Jinping and the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection represents a key element of his governance strategy, with the CCDI serving as a critical instrument for consolidating party discipline, eliminating corruption, and reinforcing political control.
