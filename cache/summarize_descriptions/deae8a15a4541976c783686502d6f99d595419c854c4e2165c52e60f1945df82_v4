He attended the inaugural party congress in 1921 and seized effective control over the Communist Party at a 1935 conference, ruling China for twenty-seven years until his death in September 1976. Mao held the title of party chairman and established Mao Zedong Thought as the guiding ideology of the Communist Party, becoming a living deity with an emotional hold over China. His body remains in a mausoleum in Tiananmen Square, and he was China's most dominant leader before Xi Jinping, whose level of personal clout has been compared to Mao's formidable status.\n\nMao consolidated control over the party through the 1942-45 Yan'an rectification movement and was known for preferring to enforce his will through purges and rectification campaigns. He railed against bureaucracy and ran campaigns by appealing directly to the people, often with disastrous consequences. He was a storyteller who used the Yugong fable in his 1945 speech to describe challenges confronting the Chinese people, comparing imperialism and feudalism to two mountains. His motto \"serve the people\" became widely known, and he popularized the \"little red book\" of quotations.\n\nDuring the early years of the People's Republic, Mao stoked patriotism for nation-building and fanned anger against Western imperialism. He was preparing to assault Taiwan when the Korean War broke out in 1950, leading him to wage war against U.S. aggression toward North Korea. Students studied Mao Zedong Thought and sang revolutionary songs lauding his achievements in creating a new China. He lionized revolutionary figures like Fang Zhimin posthumously as national heroes.\n\nMao launched the Great Leap Forward in 1958 (early 1960s), which resulted in catastrophic consequences. Seeking to reclaim authority lost from this failure and restore revolutionary fervor, he launched the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in May 1966. During this period, he championed ideas of class struggle and mass mobilization, called on people to attack the party, and his wife Jiang Qing led the Gang of Four. The Cultural Revolution wiped out economic gains and led to millions of deaths, leaving behind an impoverished populace and shattered economy when Mao died in 1976. He issued the \"Up to the Mountains and Down to the Countryside\" movement to quell Red Guards by sending urban youth to rural areas for re-education.\n\nMao's despotic rule implemented \"rule of man\" rather than rule of law. Despite his errors and megalomania, he maintained significant influence, though he worried about his legacy surviving him and attempted to designate successors. His final years saw his health and faculties fade in a prolonged decline, with rival officials scheming to become his chosen heir. The CIA analyzed his succession in 1976, anticipating his death in August before he died in September, sending China into a tense interregnum.\n\nMao's era and the Cultural Revolution became subjects of academic study, generating post-traumatic anger while also inspiring nostalgia for his egalitarian ethos. His concept of self-reliance remains relevant to contemporary Chinese policies, and Xi Jinping has invoked Mao's slogans and political practices, though shunning certain tenets like class struggle and mass mobilization. Mao is mentioned eighteen times in Xi's historical resolution and remains a central figure in Chinese political history.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"citations": null, "thinking_blocks": null}}}], "created": 1769998132, "model": "claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 796, "prompt_tokens": 1508, "total_tokens": 2304, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": null, "audio_tokens": null, "reasoning_tokens": null, "rejected_prediction_tokens": null, "text_tokens": 796}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null, "cache_creation_tokens": 0, "cache_creation_token_details": {"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens": 0, "ephemeral_1h_input_tokens": 0}}, "cache_creation_input_tokens": 0, "cache_read_input_tokens": 0}, "formatted_response": null, "content": "# Comprehensive Summary: MAO\n\nMao Zedong was a revolutionary leader and founding figure of the People's Republic of China, which he declared in 1949.
