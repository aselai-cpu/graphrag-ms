He is recognized as a leading scholar on Communist Party history and has made significant contributions to understanding the historical legacies that have shaped contemporary Chinese leadership.\n\nTorigian's research methodology is notably rigorous, drawing from diverse primary sources including memoirs, unpublished diaries, and interviews with friends of prominent political families. This meticulous approach has enabled him to provide nuanced insights into the personal and political development of Chinese leaders.\n\nA significant portion of Torigian's work focuses on Xi Jinping and his family background. He has written extensively about what Xi Jinping learned from his father, Xi Zhongxun, particularly regarding Xinjiang policy and governance. His research has explored Xi Jinping's early life experiences and how they shaped his worldviews and political philosophy. Notably, Torigian authored an article for Foreign Policy examining Xi Jinping's family lessons from the Tiananmen Square incident, demonstrating how historical events influenced the current Chinese leader's perspectives.\n\nTorigian has also made important scholarly contributions by critically examining historical narratives. For instance, he cited evidence suggesting that Xi Zhongxun's alleged outburst in defense of Hu Yaobang—a story that has circulated in various accounts—may not have actually occurred. This demonstrates his commitment to historical accuracy and his willingness to challenge accepted narratives when evidence warrants it. Additionally, he noted the historical connection between Xi Jinping and Yang Jiechi, both of whom were part of Geng Biao's delegation, revealing important networks in Chinese political history.\n\nHis comparative expertise extends beyond China to the Soviet Union. Torigian authored a book that analyzes succession struggles in both countries following the deaths of their respective leaders, Stalin and Mao.
