These events appear to have influenced his subsequent approach to the region. He inherited existing separatist sentiment in Xinjiang and has since sought to forge a common consciousness there, aiming to suppress dissent and end ethnic violence through systematic policies.\n\nIn 2014, Xi Jinping committed to a hard-line approach in Xinjiang. He wrapped up a tour of the region that year just as a knife-and-bomb attack occurred, which appears to have been a pivotal moment. Following this incident, he ordered an all-out pacification campaign and directed a withering security and assimilation campaign across the region, demanding compliance in the most draconian ways. This marked the beginning of aggressive assimilation policies that would fundamentally transform Xinjiang.\n\nUnder Xi Jinping's direction, Xinjiang was transformed into a test bed for surveillance and coercion techniques. He played an extensive role in implementing policies that included mass detention programs targeting the region's Muslim population. His policies were studied within Xinjiang detention facilities, demonstrating the systematic nature of the campaign. Despite international criticism, Xi Jinping has declared the party's strategy for governing Xinjiang to be \"completely correct\" and has stated that China will continue efforts to assimilate Muslims in the region.\n\nThe ethnic policies and governance implemented by Xi Jinping in Xinjiang represent a comprehensive approach combining security measures, surveillance technology, detention programs, and cultural assimilation efforts.
