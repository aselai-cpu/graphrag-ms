He applied to join the Communist Party ten times before finally becoming a member in January 1974. After gaining membership, he rose through the ranks to become party secretary of Liangjiahe, marking the beginning of a long political career within the party structure.\n\nXi eventually ascended to the highest position within the Communist Party, becoming General Secretary. His leadership has been characterized by significant consolidation of power and centralization of authority within the party. Xi's power and authority are entirely derived from and inseparable from the Communist Party itself—he has no existence separate from it, and the party remains the foundation of his political legitimacy.\n\nAs the top party leader, Xi has implemented sweeping reforms aimed at strengthening organizational integrity and tightening party control. He has conducted extensive purges to consolidate his power and has ordered cadres to unify their thinking in alignment with party directives. His leadership style emphasizes that the party must always win, and he has issued warnings to party members to maintain discipline and loyalty. Criticism of Xi's leadership has resulted in detentions and user detentions, demonstrating the严格 enforcement of party authority.\n\nXi has significantly bolstered the Communist Party's legal toolkit and led extensive propaganda campaigns to maintain ideological control. He chairs multiple Communist Party commissions and personally leads the party's foreign policy direction. Under his leadership, the party has been used to tighten state control over the private sector, expanding government influence into economic affairs.\n\nXi has promoted several signature initiatives and concepts during his tenure. He introduced and promoted the \"China Dream\" concept, positioning himself as a current generation Communist leader who vows to deliver national rejuvenation and chart a new course for the party. He has launched major campaigns including rural poverty elimination, common prosperity initiatives, and organized crime crackdowns. Additionally, Xi doubled down on patriotic education after taking office, emphasizing nationalist sentiment and party loyalty.\n\nXi is closely associated with the Communist Party's Taiwan unification strategy, making reunification a key policy objective. His leadership represents a period of intensified party control over all aspects of Chinese society, from the economy to education to foreign policy.\n\nIn summary, Xi Jinping's identity and authority are fundamentally intertwined with the Communist Party. His leadership has been marked by centralization of power, ideological campaigns, anti-corruption purges, and an assertive vision for China's future under continued party dominance.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"citations": null, "thinking_blocks": null}}}], "created": 1769998496, "model": "claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 541, "prompt_tokens": 506, "total_tokens": 1047, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": null, "audio_tokens": null, "reasoning_tokens": null, "rejected_prediction_tokens": null, "text_tokens": 541}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null, "cache_creation_tokens": 0, "cache_creation_token_details": {"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens": 0, "ephemeral_1h_input_tokens": 0}}, "cache_creation_input_tokens": 0, "cache_read_input_tokens": 0}, "formatted_response": null, "content": "# Comprehensive Summary: Xi and the Communist Party\n\nXi Jinping's relationship with the Communist Party of China began with persistence and dedication.
