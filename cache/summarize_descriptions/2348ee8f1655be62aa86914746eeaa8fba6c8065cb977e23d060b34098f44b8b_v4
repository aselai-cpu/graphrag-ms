His multifaceted career has focused extensively on examining the complex dynamics between the United States and China from various perspectives.\n\nAs a journalist and writer, Schell has documented China's transformation and opening up to the world, specifically exploring how journalism played a crucial role in facilitating China's engagement with the international community. His work in this area has provided valuable insights into the mechanisms and processes through which China became more accessible and transparent during its reform period.\n\nIn his capacity as a researcher and analyst, Schell has co-authored important reports examining China's influence operations and their implications for American interests. Most notably, he served as the lead author of a significant 2018 report that urged the United States to adopt a firmer stance in resisting Beijing's influence efforts. This report represents a critical contribution to the ongoing debate about how democratic nations should respond to China's growing global influence and soft power initiatives.\n\nSchell's analytical work extends to authoring articles that examine U.S.-China engagement strategies and messaging. Through these writings, he has contributed to shaping the discourse on how the United States should communicate with and about China, as well as how both nations can navigate their increasingly complex relationship.\n\nHis body of work reflects a nuanced understanding of China that spans from documenting its opening and reform period to critically analyzing its contemporary influence operations. This evolution in focus suggests that Schell has adapted his perspective over time, moving from observing China's integration into the global community to examining the challenges this integration poses for American interests and democratic values.\n\nOrville Schell's contributions to the field of U.S.-China relations are characterized by rigorous research, thoughtful analysis, and a willingness to address difficult questions about power, influence, and international engagement.
