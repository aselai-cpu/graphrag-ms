As the party's principal oversight body, it serves as an internal watchdog responsible for policing the conduct of the Communist Party's more than 96 million members.\n\n## Structure and Operations\n\nThe CCDI operates with a comprehensive organizational structure modeled on Soviet systems. It directs an extensive network that includes regional and local branches, roving inspection teams, and embedded agents that penetrate all levels of government. This network enables the organization to supervise every party and state organization across China, ensuring comprehensive oversight of party discipline and conduct.\n\n## Powers and Authority\n\nThe CCDI operates outside China's formal legal system, granting it extraordinary powers in its investigative and enforcement capabilities. The organization can seize evidence without warrants and detain suspects almost indefinitely during its investigations. These broad authorities enable the CCDI to conduct thorough disciplinary reviews and supervisory investigations of officials suspected of violations.\n\n## Responsibilities and Functions\n\nThe organization's primary responsibilities include investigating disciplinary violations, corruption cases, and other misconduct by party members. It is responsible for both investigating and disciplining party members who commit violations of party rules and regulations. The CCDI also oversees poverty alleviation supervision efforts, demonstrating its role extends beyond traditional anti-corruption work to broader governance issues.\n\n## Public Communication and Transparency\n\nThe CCDI maintains an active public presence through its website, where it publishes official information about ongoing investigations and corruption cases. The organization has published articles and information about numerous high-profile cases, including investigations of officials such as Meng Hongwei and Kong Lingbao's corruption case. It provides official data on corruption cases, contributing to public awareness of anti-corruption efforts.\n\n## Facilities and Leadership Engagement\n\nThe organization has undergone infrastructure development, including the relocation of its West Campus, which combines workspaces dedicated to fighting corruption. The CCDI's significance within the party hierarchy is evidenced by high-level engagement, including a speech delivered by Xi Jinping at its Sixth Plenary Session, underscoring the organization's central role in the Communist Party's governance structure and anti-corruption campaign.\n\nThrough its extensive powers, comprehensive network, and central position within the party apparatus, the CCDI serves as the primary mechanism for maintaining discipline and combating corruption within China's Communist Party and government structures.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"citations": null, "thinking_blocks": null}}}], "created": 1769998232, "model": "claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 539, "prompt_tokens": 525, "total_tokens": 1064, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": null, "audio_tokens": null, "reasoning_tokens": null, "rejected_prediction_tokens": null, "text_tokens": 539}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null, "cache_creation_tokens": 0, "cache_creation_token_details": {"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens": 0, "ephemeral_1h_input_tokens": 0}}, "cache_creation_input_tokens": 0, "cache_read_input_tokens": 0}, "formatted_response": null, "content": "# Central Commission for Discipline Inspection (CCDI)\n\nThe Central Commission for Discipline Inspection (CCDI) is the Chinese Communist Party's top discipline enforcement and anti-corruption agency, operating from central Beijing.
