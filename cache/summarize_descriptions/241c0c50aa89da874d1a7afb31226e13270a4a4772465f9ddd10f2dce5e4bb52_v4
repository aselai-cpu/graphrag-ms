In response to Western criticism regarding Xinjiang, Beijing has developed specific countermeasures to address and deflect international scrutiny of its policies in the region. This defensive posture demonstrates Beijing's commitment to protecting what it considers its internal affairs from external interference and criticism.\n\nSimultaneously, Beijing has pursued a more balanced diplomatic approach in its broader relationship with the West. Despite tensions and disagreements on various issues, including human rights concerns in Xinjiang, Beijing actively seeks to maintain stable ties with Western nations. This dual strategy reflects Beijing's pragmatic foreign policy approach, where it attempts to preserve important economic, diplomatic, and strategic relationships with the West while simultaneously defending its core interests and resisting what it perceives as unwarranted interference in its domestic policies.\n\nThe relationship illustrates Beijing's careful balancing act between engagement and resistance. On one hand, Beijing recognizes the importance of stable relations with the West for economic development, trade partnerships, and global stability. On the other hand, Beijing remains firm in fighting for its interests when it believes its sovereignty or policy decisions are being challenged, particularly regarding sensitive issues like Xinjiang.\n\nThis approach suggests that Beijing views its relationship with the West through a strategic lens, seeking cooperation where possible while maintaining clear boundaries on issues it considers non-negotiable.
