She has been actively engaged in discussing and managing diplomatic challenges, as Taiwan continues to face international pressure regarding its diplomatic recognition and participation in global organizations. Additionally, she has focused on security challenges, particularly concerning Taiwan's defense capabilities and strategic position in the face of increasing regional tensions.
