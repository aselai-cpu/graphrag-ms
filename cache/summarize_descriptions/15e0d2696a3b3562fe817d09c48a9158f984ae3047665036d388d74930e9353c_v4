As a prominent global newspaper, the Financial Times has reported on a wide range of significant stories related to China.\n\nThe publication has covered major public health issues, including reporting on COVID-19 infection estimates in China, providing international audiences with critical information during the pandemic. Beyond health matters, the Financial Times has demonstrated consistent coverage of Chinese political and educational institutions, particularly in relation to government oversight and control.\n\nThe Financial Times has reported extensively on matters involving prominent Chinese business figures, most notably Jack Ma. The publication covered the story of Beijing forcing Jack Ma's Hupan University (also referred to as Jack Ma academy) to halt enrollments, and separately reported on the government's broader concerns about Hupan University. This coverage highlights the publication's focus on the intersection of business, education, and government control in China.\n\nThe newspaper has also addressed issues of censorship and media freedom, publishing articles about global publishers bowing to China censors, demonstrating its commitment to reporting on press freedom and international media dynamics in relation to Chinese government policies.\n\nIn the realm of political accountability and academic integrity, the Financial Times published investigative journalism on plagiarism among Chinese officials. Specifically, in February 2019, journalists Tom Hancock and Nicolle Liu authored an article exposing plagiarism in doctoral dissertations by top Chinese officials. This reporting revealed ethical concerns at the highest levels of Chinese government and academia.\n\nAdditionally, the Financial Times has published articles examining China's Communist Party and corporate governance, exploring the complex relationship between political power and business operations in China. This coverage reflects the publication's broader interest in understanding how China's political system influences its economic and corporate structures.\n\nThe Financial Times serves as a referenced and respected source in discussions about Chinese politics, business, and society, providing international readers with in-depth analysis and investigative reporting on developments within China.
