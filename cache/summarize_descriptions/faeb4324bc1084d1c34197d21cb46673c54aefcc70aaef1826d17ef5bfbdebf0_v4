He is a princeling, meaning he is the son of a senior official, and formerly served as chairman of a state enterprise. Due to his bold and candid views, he earned the nickname \"Cannon Ren.\"\n\nRen Zhiqiang gained significant attention in 2016 when he went online to publicly criticize President Xi Jinping's demands for absolute loyalty and fealty from Chinese media outlets. This act of defiance led to immediate consequences: his social media accounts were shut down, and his Communist Party membership was suspended in May 2016. Despite being well-connected with powerful politicians and having friends in high places, Ren's willingness to speak out against the party leadership made him a target.\n\nThe situation escalated dramatically in 2020 when Ren Zhiqiang criticized Xi Jinping's handling of the coronavirus pandemic and the party's response to Covid-19. Following these criticisms, he was detained by authorities and faced prosecution. He was subsequently expelled from the Communist Party entirely—moving beyond the earlier suspension of his membership.\n\nIn September 2020, Ren Zhiqiang was sentenced to eighteen years in prison. The official charges brought against him included corruption, embezzlement, and abuse of power. Many observers have noted that these corruption-related charges came in the context of his vocal criticism of Xi Jinping and the party's policies, suggesting that the legal proceedings may have been politically motivated. His case has been mentioned prominently in discussions about corruption investigations in China, though the timing and nature of the charges have raised questions about their connection to his political dissent.\n\nRen Zhiqiang's case represents a significant example of the Chinese government's approach to handling criticism from within its own ranks, particularly from individuals with elite backgrounds and party connections. Despite his princeling status and previous position of privilege within the system, his outspoken nature and willingness to challenge Xi Jinping's authority ultimately led to his downfall.
