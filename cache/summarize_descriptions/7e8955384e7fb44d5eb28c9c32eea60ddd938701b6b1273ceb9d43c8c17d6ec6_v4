His work was extensive and meticulous, compiling data on 67,502 protests throughout the country. This documentation of social unrest made him a target of Chinese authorities, who viewed his activities as threatening to state stability and control.\n\nAs a result of his activism and documentation work, Lu faced severe consequences from the Chinese government. He was arrested for his efforts to track and publicize incidents of public dissent. Following his arrest, authorities barred him from leaving China, effectively trapping him within the country's borders. Lu now lives under constant surveillance by Chinese security services, with authorities having explicitly threatened him over his online speech and activities. His case represents the Chinese government's broader crackdown on activists, researchers, and citizens who document or publicize social unrest and challenges to state authority.\n\n## Contradictory Account: Lu the Diplomat\n\nOne description presents a contradictory characterization, identifying Lu as a Chinese diplomat who defended \"wolf warrior diplomacy\" - China's aggressive, confrontational approach to foreign policy that emerged prominently in recent years.
