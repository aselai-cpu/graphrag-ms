His work has appeared in prominent publications including The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal.\n\nMozur has established himself as a key reporter on China's surveillance state and its use of advanced technology for monitoring and control. He co-authored a significant New York Times article examining China's deployment of high-tech surveillance systems, providing crucial insights into how the Chinese government leverages cutting-edge technology to monitor its population. His reporting has also explored the involvement of U.S. technology companies in China's surveillance infrastructure, highlighting the complex relationship between American tech firms and Chinese government initiatives.\n\nIn addition to surveillance issues, Mozur has reported extensively on China's social media landscape and the government's efforts to control online discourse. He co-authored an article for The Wall Street Journal documenting China's social media crackdown, detailing the government's systematic efforts to restrict and monitor online communications. His New York Times reporting has also covered the serious consequences faced by Twitter users in China, including cases of detention, illustrating the risks that Chinese citizens face when using platforms not sanctioned by the government.\n\nBeyond mainland China issues, Mozur has also covered Taiwan-related topics, including reporting on a Taiwan opposition leader's stance regarding China. This demonstrates his broader expertise in cross-strait relations and the complex political dynamics between Taiwan and mainland China.\n\nThroughout his career, Paul Mozur has demonstrated a consistent focus on the intersection of technology, government control, and civil liberties in China. His investigative journalism has shed light on critical issues affecting millions of people, from the expansion of surveillance capabilities to the suppression of online expression. His work has contributed significantly to international understanding of China's technological authoritarianism and its implications for human rights, privacy, and freedom of expression.\n\nMozur's reporting represents an important body of work that documents one of the most significant developments in modern governance: the use of advanced technology for state surveillance and social control.
