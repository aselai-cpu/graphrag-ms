As early as 1979, he spoke publicly about the dangers of life-tenure for the highest party and state leaders, identifying this as a critical vulnerability in China's governance structure. His analysis extended to examining patterns of leadership succession in China, contributing important scholarly work on how power transitions occurred within the authoritarian system.\n\nYan Jiaqi's intellectual contributions include significant writings on Chinese authoritarianism.
