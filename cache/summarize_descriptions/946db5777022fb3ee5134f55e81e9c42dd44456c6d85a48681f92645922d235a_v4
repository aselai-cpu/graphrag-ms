He spent six years in prison for wounding someone in a street fight, an experience that appears to have shaped his later activism.\n\nAfter his release, Lu quit his job at a plastics factory to become a full-time documenter of public incidents and protests in China. He utilized social media platforms, particularly Weibo, to post his findings and share information about demonstrations and social unrest across the country.
