Her work focuses on two primary areas of Chinese governmental activities and policies.\n\nFirst, Eva Xiao has reported extensively on the activities of Chinese propaganda officials, covering how the Chinese government manages and disseminates information through its propaganda apparatus. This reporting likely encompasses the strategies, methods, and operations employed by these officials to shape public opinion and control narratives both domestically and internationally.\n\nSecond, Eva Xiao's reporting addresses China's ethnic assimilation and surveillance practices. This aspect of her work examines how the Chinese government implements policies aimed at assimilating ethnic minority populations, as well as the extensive surveillance systems deployed to monitor citizens. These topics are particularly relevant in the context of China's treatment of ethnic minorities, including groups such as the Uyghurs and other populations in regions like Xinjiang and Tibet, where concerns about human rights, cultural preservation, and state monitoring have drawn international attention.\n\nThrough her journalism, Eva Xiao provides critical insights into China's domestic policies, particularly those related to information control, ethnic relations, and state surveillance mechanisms. Her reporting contributes to the broader understanding of how the Chinese government exercises control over its population and manages ethnic diversity within its borders.\n\nChina, as the subject of Eva Xiao's reporting, is characterized by its sophisticated propaganda infrastructure and comprehensive surveillance and assimilation programs targeting ethnic minorities.
