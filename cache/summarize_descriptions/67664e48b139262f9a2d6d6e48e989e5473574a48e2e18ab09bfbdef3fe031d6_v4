The most prominent of these incidents centers on the arrest and detention of Meng Wanzhou, Huawei's Chief Financial Officer (CFO), in December 2018. Canadian authorities detained Meng Wanzhou at the request of Washington (the United States), which triggered a major diplomatic crisis between Canada and China.\n\nIn retaliation for Meng Wanzhou's detention, China took punitive measures against Canada, including the detention of two Canadian citizens (also referred to as Canadian nationals). This tit-for-tat response exemplified the deteriorating relationship between the two countries and highlighted how Canada became caught in the middle of U.S.-China tensions over Huawei and broader technology and security concerns.\n\nCanada has also been the subject of diplomatic tensions involving Chinese officials stationed in the country. Lu Shaye served as Chinese ambassador to Canada, where he addressed issues related to justice and double standards in the bilateral relationship. During his tenure, the Chinese ambassador made controversial statements, including accusations of \"white supremacy\" directed at Canadian hosts, further straining diplomatic relations between the two nations.\n\nAdditional diplomatic friction occurred when China's Foreign Minister Wang Yi confronted a Canadian reporter about China's human rights record during a visit where Canada's foreign minister was present. This incident demonstrated China's sensitivity to criticism and its willingness to publicly challenge Canadian media and officials on such matters.\n\nCanada has also played a role in China's efforts to repatriate individuals accused of corruption. Lai Changxing, a notable figure, fled to Canada to escape prosecution in China but was eventually deported back to China in 2011, demonstrating Canada's cooperation with Chinese authorities on certain legal matters despite broader tensions.\n\nIn terms of regional security dynamics, Canada has participated in Quad joint naval exercises in the Pacific Ocean, signaling its involvement in multilateral security arrangements in the Indo-Pacific region. This participation suggests Canada's strategic interest in maintaining a presence in the region and potentially balancing China's growing influence.\n\nThroughout these various incidents and interactions, Canada has found itself navigating complex diplomatic challenges involving China, the United States, and broader questions of international law, human rights, and geopolitical alignment.
