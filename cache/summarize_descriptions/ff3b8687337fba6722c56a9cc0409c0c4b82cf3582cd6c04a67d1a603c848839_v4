This visit proved to be a significant diplomatic and ideological milestone in the relationship between China and Singapore.\n\nDuring this 1978 visit, Deng Xiaoping met with Lee Kuan Yew, Singapore's founding Prime Minister. In their discussions, Lee Kuan Yew shared important insights with Deng Xiaoping regarding the identity of Chinese Singaporeans. Lee explained how ethnic Chinese citizens in Singapore identified themselves primarily as Singaporeans rather than as Chinese nationals, illustrating Singapore's successful nation-building efforts and the integration of its multi-ethnic population into a cohesive national identity.\n\nThis visit and the conversations that took place during it had a profound impact on Deng Xiaoping's thinking. The observations he made about Singapore's economic development, efficient governance, and social policies would later influence his approach to China's economic reforms and opening-up policies. Singapore's model of combining economic prosperity with political stability, along with its pragmatic approach to governance, served as an important reference point for Deng as he charted China's modernization path following the Cultural Revolution.\n\nThe 1978 visit to Singapore was part of Deng Xiaoping's broader efforts to learn from successful Asian economies and to explore alternative development models for China.
