In this capacity, he commands China's armed forces and exercises close, direct control over the military institution.\n\nSince assuming leadership, Xi Jinping has undertaken major reforms and modernization efforts of the People's Liberation Army. These reforms have been comprehensive in scope, including significant structural changes such as cutting 300,000 personnel from the military ranks. His modernization initiatives are aimed at transforming the PLA into a more capable and technologically advanced fighting force.\n\nXi Jinping has maintained tight control over the People's Liberation Army through strategic personnel management. He has purged senior generals, likely those perceived as disloyal or corrupt, while simultaneously promoting officers loyal to his leadership. This approach has allowed him to consolidate his authority over the military and ensure alignment with his strategic vision.\n\nUnder Xi Jinping's leadership, the People's Liberation Army has increasingly demonstrated and flexed its capabilities to wage war and project power beyond China's borders. This represents a significant shift in the PLA's operational posture, reflecting both the success of modernization efforts and China's growing ambitions as a global power. The military's enhanced ability to project power signals China's intention to play a more assertive role in regional and international security matters.\n\nXi Jinping's relationship with the People's Liberation Army represents a central pillar of his political power and his broader strategy for China's national development.
