People flock to churches and chapels in observance of the religious significance of the day, while others carry their dinners to bakers' shops—a common Victorian practice where families would bring their prepared meals to be cooked in the baker's ovens. During these celebrations, the Spirit blesses the poor with his torch, extending goodwill and grace to those most in need.\n\nThe Cratchit family exemplifies the warmth and togetherness of Christmas Day celebrations. They gather for a special Christmas dinner and feast, coming together as a family unit to share in the holiday's joy despite their modest circumstances. The family raises toasts during their gathering, celebrating not only the holiday itself but also their bonds with one another.\n\nChristmas Day thus functions on multiple levels within the story: as a marker of Scrooge's personal transformation from a miserly, cold-hearted man to one capable of generosity and compassion; as a day of religious observance and spiritual significance for the community; and as an occasion for families like the Cratchits to gather, feast, and celebrate together.
