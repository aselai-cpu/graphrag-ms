As an imperialist power, Britain defeated China in the First Opium War during the mid-19th century, subsequently imposing unequal treaties that significantly disadvantaged China. These historical events, beginning in the 1840s, have become central to China's national narrative. In patriotic education materials used within China, Britain is portrayed as a bullying force that exploited and humiliated pre-1949 China, contributing to what Chinese historical discourse refers to as the \"Century of Humiliation.\"\n\n## Contemporary Relations\n\nIn the modern era, Britain and China maintain ongoing relations, though these have become increasingly strained. The contemporary relationship encompasses diplomatic, economic, and political dimensions, but recent years have seen significant deterioration in mutual perceptions and trust.\n\n## Recent Tensions\n\nBy 2020, Britain was identified among the countries where unfavorable views of China reached record levels. This dramatic shift in public opinion reflects growing concerns about various issues, including human rights, trade practices, technology security, and geopolitical competition. The deteriorating perception represents a significant challenge to bilateral relations between the two nations.\n\n## Hong Kong Dispute\n\nA particular point of contention in the modern Britain-China relationship centers on Hong Kong. Despite Britain's historical role in administering Hong Kong until its 1997 handover to China, the Chinese government has explicitly stated that Britain has no moral responsibility for Hong Kong. This position reflects China's rejection of British commentary or involvement in Hong Kong affairs, which China considers an internal matter. This dispute highlights the ongoing tension between Britain's historical connection to the territory and China's assertion of complete sovereignty.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe Britain-China relationship represents a complex interplay between historical grievances and contemporary geopolitical realities. While the two nations maintain diplomatic and economic ties, their relationship is burdened by historical animosity stemming from 19th-century imperialism and complicated by modern disagreements over issues such as Hong Kong's governance and broader questions of human rights and international norms. The record-low favorable views of China in Britain as of 2020 suggest that these tensions continue to shape public opinion and may influence future bilateral relations between these two significant global powers.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"citations": null, "thinking_blocks": null}}}], "created": 1769998669, "model": "claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 522, "prompt_tokens": 257, "total_tokens": 779, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": null, "audio_tokens": null, "reasoning_tokens": null, "rejected_prediction_tokens": null, "text_tokens": 522}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null, "cache_creation_tokens": 0, "cache_creation_token_details": {"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens": 0, "ephemeral_1h_input_tokens": 0}}, "cache_creation_input_tokens": 0, "cache_read_input_tokens": 0}, "formatted_response": null, "content": "# Comprehensive Summary: Britain-China Relations\n\nBritain and China share a complex relationship spanning historical and contemporary dimensions, marked by periods of conflict, imperialism, and evolving modern tensions.\n\n## Historical Relations\n\nBritain's relationship with China has deep historical roots characterized by imperial aggression and exploitation.
