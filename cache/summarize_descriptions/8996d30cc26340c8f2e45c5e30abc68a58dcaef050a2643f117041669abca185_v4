They operated as violent vigilantes, targeting what they deemed to be counter-revolutionary elements, class enemies, and bourgeois elements within Chinese society.\n\nTheir methods of persecution were brutal and far-reaching. The Red Guards engaged in violent struggle sessions where they publicly humiliated and tortured their victims. They employed big-character posters (dazibao) as a tool to publicly accuse and denounce individuals they identified as class enemies. Their destructive activities extended beyond individual persecution to include systematic cultural destruction, as they rampaged through museums, libraries, and religious sites, deliberately destroying cultural relics and artifacts in an effort to eliminate what they considered the \"Four Olds\" (old customs, old culture, old habits, and old ideas).\n\nThe impact of the Red Guards' actions was deeply personal and traumatic for countless Chinese families. Among their many victims was Yi Xiaoxiong's father, who was persecuted by these groups, representing just one example of the widespread suffering inflicted during this period.\n\nThe Red Guards' activities reached a critical point by July 1968, when Mao himself became involved in events concerning these groups. Eventually, recognizing that the Red Guards' violent activities had spiraled out of control and threatened social stability, Mao took action to quell their movement by sending many of these radical youth to rural areas, effectively disbanding their urban power base.\n\nDecades later, the legacy of the Red Guards' actions continued to haunt Chinese society.
