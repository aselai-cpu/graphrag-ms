At the time of Marley's death, Scrooge served in multiple capacities as Marley's sole executor, administrator, friend, and mourner, indicating that Scrooge was the closest person to Marley and handled all aspects of his estate and funeral arrangements. This detail underscores both the depth of their relationship and Scrooge's solitary nature, as he appears to have been Marley's only meaningful connection.\n\nFollowing Marley's death, Scrooge took over the chambers that once belonged to his former partner, continuing to live and presumably work in spaces that carry memories of their shared past. Despite Marley's death occurring seven years ago, his presence remains significant in Scrooge's life, both physically through the inherited living quarters and symbolically through various connections to Scrooge's hearth and daily existence.\n\nThe relationship between Scrooge and Marley takes on a supernatural dimension as Marley's ghost returns to haunt Scrooge in his house.
