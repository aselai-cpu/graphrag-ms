As a party leader, Deng successfully consolidated his authority within the Communist Party and unified it around his platform of pragmatic governance and market-opening reforms, marking a significant departure from previous ideological rigidity.\n\nDeng's leadership was characterized by his implementation of major economic reforms and liberalization policies that fundamentally transformed China's economic system. He led China during what became known as the \"getting rich\" epoch, a period of unprecedented economic growth and development. His vision for the country was encapsulated in his call for the Communist Party to \"liberate thoughts,\" encouraging a more flexible and practical approach to governance and economic policy rather than strict adherence to ideological dogma.\n\nTo cement his vision and legitimize his reform agenda, Deng enacted a resolution on history, which helped establish the ideological foundation for his policies within the Communist Party framework. This resolution was crucial in allowing the party to move forward with market-oriented reforms while maintaining its political legitimacy and authority.\n\nDeng and his successors led the Communist Party by relying heavily on party members to implement various campaigns and reform initiatives throughout the country. This approach ensured that the party's organizational structure remained central to governance while adapting to new economic realities.\n\nHowever, Deng's legacy is also marked by his authoritarian response to political dissent. When faced with protests that challenged the Communist Party's authority, Deng made the decisive and controversial decision to crush these demonstrations with military force. This action demonstrated his unwavering commitment to maintaining the Communist Party's monopoly on political power, even as he pursued economic liberalization.\n\nIn summary, Deng was a complex and pivotal figure in the Communist Party who successfully balanced economic reform with political control. He transformed China from a closed, centrally planned economy into a more market-oriented system while ensuring that the Communist Party maintained its dominant political position. His leadership style combined pragmatic economic policies with firm political authority, creating a model of governance that his successors would continue to follow.
