He has established himself as a leading voice in analyzing contemporary Chinese politics, economics, and leadership dynamics.\n\nBlanchette is notably recognized for coining the term \"CCP Inc.\" to describe China's new economic model, which characterizes the increasingly intertwined relationship between the Chinese Communist Party and the country's economic structures. This conceptual framework has become influential in understanding how the Party exercises control over China's economy and business sector.\n\nIn his analytical work, Blanchette has provided insightful commentary on Chinese President Xi Jinping's leadership challenges. He has drawn comparisons between Xi's situation and that of a CEO facing disengaged employees, highlighting the potential internal resistance and motivation issues within China's political and administrative apparatus. This analogy offers a unique perspective on the governance challenges facing China's top leadership.\n\nDemonstrating his expertise in Chinese political succession and future governance scenarios, Blanchette co-authored a significant report in April 2021 for both CSIS and the Lowy Institute. This report examined potential future scenarios for leadership succession in the post-Xi Jinping era, contributing important strategic analysis on one of the most consequential questions facing China and the international community.\n\nBeyond his analytical and research work, Blanchette has also played a mentoring and advocacy role in the field of China studies. He has been credited with advocating for book projects related to China, including seeding ideas in Beijing as early as 2017 and providing guidance to authors through the proposal and drafting process.
