An engineer-turned-administrator from a humble background, Hu rose through the ranks of the Chinese Communist Party after leading the Communist Youth League in the mid-1980s, where he worked with Li Keqiang. He was elevated to the Politburo Standing Committee in 1992, effectively designated as Jiang's heir.\n\nHu received the posts of general secretary and president from Jiang Zemin in 2002-2003. Unlike some of his predecessors, he abided by the ten-year limit and relinquished all his key posts on schedule at the 2012 party congress, stepping down as general secretary and military commission chairman, with the presidency following in spring 2013. He turned over his party and military roles to Xi Jinping without fuss, marking the end of his tenure.\n\nAs a leader, Hu Jintao was often characterized as a colorless technocrat and competent caretaker, seen as bland and forgettable by foreign leaders. His years in power were sometimes called a \"lost decade,\" with critics suggesting he was incapable of bold action. He championed the notion of \"China's peaceful rise\" and \"peaceful development,\" calling for the creation of a \"harmonious society.\" He was committed to stable ties with the United States and upheld the Dengist canon while celebrating the party's successes. However, these aspirations ultimately fizzled in the public imagination, disappointing nationalists at home.\n\nHu's administration took a hardline approach to maintaining stability, though he delegated significant autonomy to lower-level authorities in suppressing civil unrest. His tenure saw increased use of judicial organs for repression, including the promotion of the \"three supremes\" judicial doctrine and the appointment of a former police official as chief justice. He continued enacting statutes and mobilizing the criminal justice system, ramping up repression while simultaneously discussing grassroots participation.\n\nDuring his leadership, Hu created Sasac to manage major state-owned enterprises and pursued anticorruption crackdowns, notably sacking Shanghai chief Chen Liangyu in 2006—an opening to strike at Jiang Zemin's camp. He also agreed with Xi's argument for broader investigations into the Wang Lijun case. Hu attempted to modernize the PLA with mixed success and reportedly seemed unaware of a stealth fighter test in 2011 during a meeting with the U.S. defense secretary.\n\nHu's influence diminished after the purge of his chief of staff Ling Jihua. In Xi Jinping's historical resolution, Hu is mentioned only once and implicitly criticized, including a noted mistake in his July 1, 2011 speech about the party's founding date during the 90th anniversary celebration.
