As the leading state publication, it plays a central role in disseminating party policies, political messaging, and official narratives to both domestic and international audiences.\n\n## Historical Significance and Cultural Revolution Era\n\nThe newspaper has a long history of publishing politically significant content, including during the Cultural Revolution when it issued controversial editorials such as \"In Praise of Lawlessness\" in 1967, authored by Xin Wu. These publications reflected the political turbulence of that era and the newspaper's role in promoting party ideology.\n\n## Coverage of Xi Jinping\n\nPeople's Daily has been particularly prominent in covering Xi Jinping's leadership, with Xi appearing in its pages with a frequency unseen since Mao Zedong. The newspaper published Xi's speech on mass-line education activities in October 2014 and featured his joint interview with BRICS media in March 2013. The publication's front pages are closely monitored for images of Xi, with extended absences fueling speculation about his well-being. The newspaper has also published content about Xi's early career, including a May 1990 report praising Ningde's anti-corruption efforts under his leadership.\n\n## Political and Policy Functions\n\nAs a state media publication, People's Daily serves multiple political functions. It has published numerous articles on party governance, poverty alleviation, institutional arrangements, and party policies. The newspaper justified significant political decisions, including the scrapping of presidential term limits, while assuring readers about the retirement system for officials. It has also published political essays emphasizing party control and articles on China's discourse power and international communication.\n\n## Notable Personnel and Contributors\n\nThe publication has featured work from various prominent figures, including articles by Li Bin (including one about not ruining art with spoofs), Gao Xiang, and Zhang Mingqing. Fu Ying published an op-ed in April 2020, and Tuo Zhen was named chief editor and president of this state media outlet.\n\n## Modern Operations and Controversies\n\nPeople's Daily operates \"central kitchens\" to control and create news content across various formats, demonstrating its role in modern media management. The newspaper runs the Xuexi Xiaozu WeChat account, extending its reach to digital platforms. It has published controversial commentaries, including one denouncing rights lawyers as \"black hands\" behind efforts to pollute the internet and disturb public order, and dismissed concerns about market volatility in 2015. The publication also initiated media campaigns, such as the June 1985 scathing report about a fake medicine scandal in Fujian that launched a media offensive against Xiang Nan, and published an op-ed denouncing spoofs of the Yellow River Cantata as sacrilegious.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"citations": null, "thinking_blocks": null}}}], "created": 1769998162, "model": "claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 641, "prompt_tokens": 856, "total_tokens": 1497, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": null, "audio_tokens": null, "reasoning_tokens": null, "rejected_prediction_tokens": null, "text_tokens": 641}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null, "cache_creation_tokens": 0, "cache_creation_token_details": {"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens": 0, "ephemeral_1h_input_tokens": 0}}, "cache_creation_input_tokens": 0, "cache_read_input_tokens": 0}, "formatted_response": null, "content": "# People's Daily: Comprehensive Summary\n\n**People's Daily** is the flagship newspaper and primary state media outlet of the Chinese Communist Party, serving as the party's official mouthpiece and one of China's most influential news organizations.
