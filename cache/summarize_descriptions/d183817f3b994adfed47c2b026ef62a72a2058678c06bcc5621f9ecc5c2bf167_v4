This prestigious institution serves as a primary center for party education and the training of Communist Party cadres at various levels of leadership.\n\nThe school has been closely associated with several prominent Chinese political figures. Xi Jinping has had a significant relationship with the institution, having served as its president and delivering multiple speeches there to cadres, including young and middle-aged officials. In early January 2013, Xi summoned top officials to the Central Party School, demonstrating its importance as a venue for high-level political gatherings. Notably, in June of an unspecified year, more than four hundred senior officials gathered at the institution to nominate a new Politburo, highlighting its role in critical party decision-making processes.\n\nDuring Xi's tenure as president, he ordered specialized training courses for county chiefs that focused on handling emergencies and maintaining social stability, reflecting the school's practical role in preparing officials for governance challenges. The institution continues to provide training to party cadres on these essential matters, along with other party-related subjects.\n\nThe Central Party School has employed several notable figures in leadership and teaching positions. He Yiting served as executive vice president, while Li Junru held the position of vice president. Professor Cai Xia was a faculty member at the institution before her expulsion, after which school officials allegedly made vague threats against her family members, illustrating the political sensitivities surrounding the institution. A former vice president of the school went on to become education minister in 2016, where he pushed for more patriotic teaching, demonstrating the school's influence on broader educational policy.\n\nThe institution's history extends back several decades, with Xi Zhongxun (Xi Jinping's father) having been ordered to undergo political education there, during which he was confined to his house to study the writings of Marx, Lenin, and Mao. This historical connection underscores the school's long-standing role in political indoctrination and ideological training.\n\nThe Central Party School is referenced extensively in various documents, indicating its central importance to the Chinese Communist Party's organizational structure.
