The CCDI serves as Xi Jinping's principal instrument for conducting his extensive anti-corruption campaign throughout the Chinese Communist Party.\n\nThe power dynamic between Xi Jinping and the CCDI is clearly hierarchical, with the CCDI required to secure Xi Jinping's approval before investigating and punishing high-ranking officials. This approval mechanism ensures that Xi maintains direct oversight and control over anti-corruption efforts targeting senior party members.\n\nXi Jinping has utilized the CCDI extensively as the primary tool for his anti-corruption campaigns, which have been sweeping in their scope and impact. The scale of these efforts is demonstrated by the agency's punishment of nearly 627,000 officials in 2021 alone, illustrating the massive reach of the anti-corruption drive under Xi's leadership.\n\nBeyond its role in combating corruption, Xi Jinping has employed the CCDI as an ideological inquisitor, expanding its function to enforce party discipline more broadly. The agency punishes not only corrupt officials but also those who deviate from Xi Jinping's directives, making it a crucial mechanism for maintaining ideological conformity and political loyalty within the party ranks.\n\nXi Jinping's commitment to using the CCDI for party consolidation was explicitly communicated to senior CCDI officials in January 2018, when he emphasized his dedication to the party's centralized unity. This statement underscored the CCDI's role not merely as an anti-corruption body but as an essential instrument for maintaining centralized party control under Xi's leadership.\n\nIn summary, the relationship between Xi Jinping and the CCDI represents a symbiotic yet hierarchical partnership where Xi relies heavily on the agency to execute his political agenda, while the CCDI operates under his direct authority and approval. The CCDI functions as both an anti-corruption mechanism and an ideological enforcement tool, serving Xi's broader objectives of consolidating power, ensuring party discipline, and maintaining centralized unity within the Chinese Communist Party.
