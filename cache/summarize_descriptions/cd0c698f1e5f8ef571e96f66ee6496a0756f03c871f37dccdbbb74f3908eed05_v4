As a Communist Party-run media outlet, Global Times serves as an official voice representing and supporting Chinese government positions and perspectives on both domestic and international issues.\n\nThe publication is characterized by its nationalistic editorial stance and its role as a state media platform that consistently reflects and promotes the positions of the Chinese government and the Communist Party. Global Times functions as more than just an independent news source; it operates as a strategic communication tool for China's political establishment, ensuring that official government viewpoints are disseminated to both domestic and international audiences.\n\nIn its reporting and editorial content, Global Times has demonstrated a pattern of defending Chinese government policies and criticizing entities or nations that are perceived to challenge or contradict China's interests.
