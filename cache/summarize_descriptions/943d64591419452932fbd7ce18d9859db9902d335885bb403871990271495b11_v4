His diplomatic career has included significant postings as Chinese Ambassador to Canada, and later as Ambassador to France, where he has served in the French Republic. Prior to these ambassadorial roles, Lu Shaye held the position of director general for African affairs, demonstrating his extensive experience across different regions and diplomatic contexts.\n\nThroughout his career, Lu Shaye has been characterized by his assertive and confrontational diplomatic style, which aligns with China's more muscular foreign policy approach. He has actively championed this aggressive diplomatic stance and has notably embraced the \"wolf warrior\" label, a term used to describe Chinese diplomats who adopt combative and nationalistic rhetoric in defense of China's interests and policies. As a seasoned diplomat with what has been described as a \"truculent streak,\" Lu Shaye has become one of Beijing's most prominent representatives of this confrontational diplomatic approach.\n\nIn his role as Ambassador to France, Lu Shaye has been particularly active in media engagement and public diplomacy. He has given multiple interviews, including a notable interview in June 2021, and has appeared on Mandarin TV to discuss various diplomatic matters. He has been especially vocal in defending China's response to the Covid-19 pandemic, using his platform to counter criticism and promote China's handling of the crisis.\n\nLu Shaye's written work and public statements have covered a range of topics central to Chinese foreign policy. He has authored articles addressing Chinese diplomacy, China's peaceful development, and the evolution of diplomatic style changes within Chinese foreign relations. His writings have also tackled what he perceives as double standards in international justice, particularly concerning the treatment of Canadians versus Chinese nationals, reflecting his willingness to directly challenge Western perspectives and policies.\n\nBased in Paris as the Chinese ambassador, Lu Shaye represents a new generation of Chinese diplomats who are more willing to engage in direct confrontation and robust defense of Chinese policies and interests. His approach marks a significant shift from the more reserved diplomatic style that previously characterized Chinese foreign relations, embodying Beijing's increasingly assertive stance on the global stage. Through his various roles and public engagements, Lu Shaye has established himself as a key figure in contemporary Chinese diplomacy and a leading voice in China's \"wolf warrior\" diplomatic movement.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"citations": null, "thinking_blocks": null}}}], "created": 1769998355, "model": "claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 522, "prompt_tokens": 389, "total_tokens": 911, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": null, "audio_tokens": null, "reasoning_tokens": null, "rejected_prediction_tokens": null, "text_tokens": 522}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null, "cache_creation_tokens": 0, "cache_creation_token_details": {"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens": 0, "ephemeral_1h_input_tokens": 0}}, "cache_creation_input_tokens": 0, "cache_read_input_tokens": 0}, "formatted_response": null, "content": "# Comprehensive Summary: Lu Shaye\n\nLu Shaye is a prominent Chinese diplomat who has served in several high-profile ambassadorial positions and become one of Beijing's most recognizable \"wolf warrior\" diplomats.
