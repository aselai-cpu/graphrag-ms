He served as public security minister and later as secretary of the Central Political and Legal Affairs Commission under President Hu Jintao, where he oversaw China's security services as a member of the Politburo Standing Committee, the highest decision-making body in China.\n\nDuring his tenure in these powerful positions, Zhou Yongkang allegedly built personal cliques within the security forces and used his considerable influence to wage factional fights within the Communist Party. He was known to be an ally of Bo Xilai, another prominent official who later fell from grace. When Bo Xilai faced political trouble, Zhou opposed plans to expel him from the party and resisted opening a broader investigation into Bo's activities.\n\nZhou Yongkang's downfall came when he was formally investigated in July 2014 for corruption and abuse of power. The announcement of his probe by the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection (CCDI) came shortly before Xi Jinping informed the Politburo Standing Committee about Ming Chai's arrest, indicating the high-level coordination involved in his case. His investigation was particularly significant as he was a retired Standing Committee member, breaking an unofficial precedent that top leaders of this rank were immune from prosecution.\n\nThe investigation revealed extensive corruption and personal misconduct. Zhou was found to have fornicated with multiple women and leaked state secrets, in addition to his corruption and abuse of power. The scale of corruption was staggering: authorities seized at least 90 billion yuan worth of assets connected to Zhou himself, while his family and associates had an additional $14.5 billion in assets confiscated by the Chinese government.\n\nZhou Yongkang ultimately received a life sentence in prison for his crimes, which included corruption, abuse of power, and leaking state secrets. His case became one of the most prominent examples of President Xi Jinping's extensive anti-corruption campaign, demonstrating that even the highest-ranking officials were not above the law.
