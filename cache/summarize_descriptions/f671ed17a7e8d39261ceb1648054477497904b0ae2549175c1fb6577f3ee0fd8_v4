The village is characterized by its traditional hillside cave dwellings and consists of more than sixty households. This location holds significant historical and political importance due to its association with Xi Jinping, the current leader of China.\n\nDuring the Cultural Revolution, Liangjiahe became the destination where a young Xi Jinping was sent for rustication, a practice of sending urban youth to rural areas for re-education. Xi was assigned to this village along with fifteen other youths during this tumultuous period in Chinese history. His time in Liangjiahe was marked by harsh living conditions, including dwelling in cave homes infested with fleas and enduring demanding farm labor. These challenging experiences during his formative years would later become an integral part of Xi Jinping's personal narrative and political identity.\n\nDespite the difficult circumstances, Xi Jinping eventually rose to become the village secretary of Liangjiahe, demonstrating early leadership capabilities that would shape his future political career. The experiences and initial aspirations he developed during his time in this remote village have been frequently referenced in relation to his early life and political development.\n\nIn contemporary China, Liangjiahe has been transformed into a prominent red tourism destination. Red tourism refers to travel to sites with historical significance to the Chinese Communist Revolution and the Communist Party's history. The village now attracts travelers and pilgrims interested in revolutionary history and those seeking to understand Xi Jinping's formative experiences. This transformation has elevated Liangjiahe from an obscure rural village to a site of national political significance.\n\nThe village has been featured extensively in state media content, which has helped promote its status as a destination for those wishing to trace the early life of China's paramount leader. These media portrayals emphasize the connection between Xi Jinping's humble beginnings in Liangjiahe and his current position, reinforcing narratives about his understanding of rural China and the common people.\n\nToday, Liangjiahe serves as both a historical site and a symbol of Xi Jinping's connection to China's revolutionary past and rural roots.
