The city functions as both a literal geographic location and a metonym for the Taiwanese government and its policies, particularly regarding defense and cross-strait relations.\n\nHistorically, Taipei has been at the center of significant political developments affecting Taiwan's international status. It was the seat of the Kuomintang government that lost diplomatic recognition as countries increasingly switched to recognizing Beijing. In 1971, the Taiwanese government based in Taipei was unseated from the United Nations, and subsequently rejected Beijing's unification formula, maintaining Taiwan's separate political identity.\n\nIn recent decades, Taipei has been the site of important domestic political movements and transitions. In 2014, students occupied legislative chambers in the capital in what became known as a significant protest movement. Two years later, in 2016, an independence-leaning president took office in Taipei, marking a shift in Taiwan's political orientation.\n\nTaipei has faced sustained pressure from Beijing regarding reunification while simultaneously experiencing strengthened ties with the United States and other democracies. During Xi Jinping's time in Fujian province, there were heightened tensions between Beijing and Taipei. Washington has arranged high-level visits to Taipei as part of its engagement with Taiwan, which Beijing views as antagonistic. Most notably, U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi visited Taipei in August 2022, a trip that generated significant international attention and increased cross-strait tensions.\n\nThe city serves as an important hub for research, media, and academic institutions. Taipei is home to Doublethink Lab, a research firm that conducts studies on various issues affecting Taiwan.
