His association with this legislative body has been marked by several historic milestones and an unprecedented level of legislative activity.\n\nXi Jinping's formal engagement with the National People's Congress began prominently in March 2013, when he delivered a speech at the First Session of the 12th National People's Congress, marking the early phase of his leadership. This initial address set the tone for what would become a highly productive and consequential partnership between Xi and the legislative body.\n\nIn 2018, the National People's Congress made two landmark decisions regarding Xi Jinping's presidency. First, the body unanimously re-elected him as President, demonstrating strong institutional support for his continued leadership. Second, and perhaps more significantly, the National People's Congress voted to remove presidential term limits, a constitutional change that received an overwhelming 99.8 percent approval rate. This historic vote effectively allowed Xi Jinping to serve beyond the traditional two-term limit, fundamentally altering China's political landscape and enabling him to extend his tenure indefinitely.\n\nThroughout his time in power, Xi Jinping has also participated in ceremonial occasions with the National People's Congress, including delivering a speech at the 60th anniversary celebration of the legislative body, underscoring the importance of this institution in China's governance structure.\n\nOne of the most notable aspects of Xi Jinping's relationship with the National People's Congress has been the extraordinary pace of legislative activity during his leadership. Under Xi's direction, the National People's Congress passed laws at an unprecedented rate, particularly during his first decade in power. This accelerated legislative agenda reflects Xi's ambitious reform program and his ability to mobilize the institutional machinery of the Chinese state to implement his policy vision efficiently.\n\nThe collaboration between Xi Jinping and the National People's Congress represents a period of significant institutional activity and political consolidation in modern Chinese governance. The removal of term limits, combined with the rapid pace of lawmaking and unanimous electoral support, illustrates the degree to which Xi has been able to work effectively with this key legislative body to advance his political agenda and strengthen his position as China's paramount leader.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"citations": null, "thinking_blocks": null}}}], "created": 1769998518, "model": "claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 485, "prompt_tokens": 324, "total_tokens": 809, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": null, "audio_tokens": null, "reasoning_tokens": null, "rejected_prediction_tokens": null, "text_tokens": 485}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null, "cache_creation_tokens": 0, "cache_creation_token_details": {"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens": 0, "ephemeral_1h_input_tokens": 0}}, "cache_creation_input_tokens": 0, "cache_read_input_tokens": 0}, "formatted_response": null, "content": "# Comprehensive Summary: Xi Jinping and the National People's Congress\n\nXi Jinping has maintained a significant and transformative relationship with the National People's Congress throughout his tenure as China's leader.
