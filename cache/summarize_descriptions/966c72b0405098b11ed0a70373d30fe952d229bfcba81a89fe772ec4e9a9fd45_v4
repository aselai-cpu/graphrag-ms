Departing from the traditional \"hide and bide\" philosophy that characterized previous Chinese foreign policy—which emphasized maintaining a low profile and avoiding confrontation—Xi Jinping has instead urged Chinese diplomats to adopt a more assertive stance. He has encouraged them to \"strive and accomplish things\" and actively enforce Communist Party narratives on the international stage. This shift represents a fundamental change in how China engages with the world, moving from a more passive, cautious approach to one that is proactive and increasingly confrontational in defending Chinese interests and ideology.\n\nThe Chinese Foreign Ministry has played a crucial role in implementing Xi Jinping's more assertive foreign policy vision. The ministry has demonstrated its commitment to protecting Xi Jinping's personal interests and those of his family members. Specifically, the Chinese Foreign Ministry took action to safeguard Xi Jinping's interests by threatening consequences over media reporting concerning his cousin. This incident illustrates the extent to which Chinese diplomatic institutions are willing to leverage their influence and issue warnings to foreign entities to prevent potentially sensitive information about Xi Jinping's family connections from being publicized.\n\nTogether, these actions by Xi Jinping and the Chinese Foreign Ministry reflect a broader pattern of increasingly assertive Chinese diplomacy, often referred to as \"wolf warrior diplomacy\" by international observers. This approach combines the active promotion of Communist Party narratives with vigorous defense of the Chinese leadership's reputation and interests, both domestically and internationally. The relationship between Xi Jinping's directives and the Chinese Foreign Ministry's actions demonstrates a coordinated effort to project Chinese power and protect the leadership's image, marking a significant departure from China's previous diplomatic strategy of avoiding controversy and maintaining a lower international profile.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"citations": null, "thinking_blocks": null}}}], "created": 1769998722, "model": "claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 397, "prompt_tokens": 223, "total_tokens": 620, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": null, "audio_tokens": null, "reasoning_tokens": null, "rejected_prediction_tokens": null, "text_tokens": 397}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null, "cache_creation_tokens": 0, "cache_creation_token_details": {"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens": 0, "ephemeral_1h_input_tokens": 0}}, "cache_creation_input_tokens": 0, "cache_read_input_tokens": 0}, "formatted_response": null, "content": "# Comprehensive Summary: Xi Jinping and Chinese Foreign Ministry\n\nXi Jinping, the leader of China's Communist Party, has significantly transformed China's diplomatic approach and foreign policy posture.
