The commission plays a crucial role in China's economic governance structure by serving as the government's representative in managing major state-owned enterprises. Its creation reflected the Chinese government's strategic approach to consolidating and professionalizing the oversight of the country's vast state-owned sector.\n\nOne of SASAC's key objectives is to transform major state-owned enterprises into \"national champions\" – large, competitive corporations capable of competing on both domestic and international stages. This mission involves not only supervision but also strategic guidance, helping SOEs improve their operational efficiency, corporate governance, and global competitiveness. Through this role, SASAC has been instrumental in shaping China's industrial policy and economic development strategy.\n\nAs the primary government commission overseeing state-owned enterprises, SASAC exercises significant influence over some of China's largest and most important companies across various sectors, including energy, telecommunications, transportation, and heavy industry.
