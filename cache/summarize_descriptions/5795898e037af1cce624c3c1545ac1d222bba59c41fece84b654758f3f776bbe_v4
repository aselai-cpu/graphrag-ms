He rose through the ranks of the party to become heir apparent and is identified as a senior leader from the post-50 generation who became a member of the Politburo Standing Committee before ascending to the party's highest position.\n\nAs General Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party Central Committee, Xi Jinping holds multiple leadership titles, including President of China and Chairman of the Central Military Commission. He secured a third term as party leader in 2022 at the 20th National Congress with what officials described as unanimous support, extending his rule and consolidating his position as a historic figure within the party. The CCP has elevated his stature significantly, designating him as a historic figure comparable to previous paramount leaders.\n\nXi Jinping has fundamentally transformed the Chinese Communist Party through extensive institutional changes and rule-making. He has worked systematically to rejuvenate, strengthen, and centralize the party's control over Chinese society. His leadership has been characterized by strict enforcement of party discipline, with Xi demanding absolute loyalty from party members and implementing comprehensive party discipline policies. He has led major anti-corruption campaigns and party construction efforts, initiating purges to consolidate control and eliminate opposition within the party ranks.\n\nA prolific writer on party governance, Xi Jinping has written extensively about governing the party, the Party's 18th National Congress, Chinese socialism, and cross-century leading cadres for party publications. He delivered a significant report at the party's 19th National Congress and regularly delivers speeches at party seminars, managing and promoting Chinese Communist Party activities and ideology.\n\nXi Jinping has taken particular interest in shaping the party's historical narrative and propaganda efforts. He supervised party history projects and created a new authoritative narrative for the CCP in the 2021 Short History book, working to legitimize Communist rule through controlled historical interpretation. He directs the party's propaganda apparatus and controls the mechanisms through which the party maintains its grip on power.\n\nUnder Xi's leadership, the Chinese Communist Party has expanded its reach into all aspects of Chinese life. He guides the party's direction on ethnic work and other policy areas, ensuring the party's ideology permeates throughout society.
