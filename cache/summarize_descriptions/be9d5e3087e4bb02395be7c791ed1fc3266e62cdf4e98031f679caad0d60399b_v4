Shan Li authored articles examining Jack Ma's relationship with the Communist Party of China, specifically reporting on Ma becoming a Communist Party member. This reporting is particularly significant given the complex relationship between China's tech entrepreneurs and the government, and the public interest in understanding how influential business figures navigate the country's political system.\n\nAdditionally, Shan Li has reported on Chinese startup culture, providing insights into the rapidly evolving entrepreneurial ecosystem in China.
