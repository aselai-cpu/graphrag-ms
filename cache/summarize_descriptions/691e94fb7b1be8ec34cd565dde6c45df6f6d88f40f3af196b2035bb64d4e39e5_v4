While the two nations maintain active diplomatic channels, their relationship has been marked by disputes over sensitive issues, particularly concerning human rights and China's Xinjiang region.

In a notable shift in global economic power, China leapfrogged France to become the world's second-biggest economy. This economic transformation fundamentally altered the dynamic between the two nations, with China transitioning from a developing country to an economic superpower while France, despite remaining one of the world's major economies, was surpassed in terms of overall economic size.
