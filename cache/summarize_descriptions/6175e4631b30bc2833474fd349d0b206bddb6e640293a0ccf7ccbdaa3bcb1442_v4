She is notably indignant about Scrooge's conduct and displays no patience with him, suggesting she is forthright in her opinions and unafraid to express disapproval of his miserly and antisocial ways.\n\nDuring the Christmas gathering at Fred's home, Scrooge's niece actively participates in the festivities and entertainment. She is musically talented, playing the harp well, which adds to the joyful atmosphere of the celebration. She also engages enthusiastically in party games, including blind man's-buff, though during this particular game she sits in a comfortable chair, suggesting she may be observing or taking a break from more active participation while still remaining part of the social gathering.\n\nOverall, Scrooge's niece emerges as a vivacious, attractive, and principled young woman who embodies the warmth and generosity of spirit that stands in stark contrast to Scrooge's cold demeanor.
