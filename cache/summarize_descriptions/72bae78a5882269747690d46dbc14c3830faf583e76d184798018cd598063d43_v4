This transition was formalized through a Joint Declaration signed by China, which established the framework for Hong Kong's governance under the \"One Country, Two Systems\" policy. This policy was designed to allow Hong Kong to maintain certain distinct characteristics while operating under Chinese sovereignty.\n\nSince the handover, China exercises comprehensive jurisdiction over Hong Kong and maintains control over its governance. This relationship has evolved significantly over the years, particularly in terms of political control and administrative oversight. The implementation of China's authority has manifested in various ways, including regulatory changes that have affected multiple sectors within Hong Kong.\n\nOne notable area of impact has been the education sector, where China has education companies listed in Hong Kong markets. These companies were significantly affected by regulatory changes implemented by Chinese authorities, demonstrating the direct influence of mainland Chinese policy decisions on Hong Kong's financial markets and business environment.\n\nThe political relationship between China and Hong Kong has become increasingly contentious, particularly regarding civil liberties and political freedoms. China has actively suppressed dissent in Hong Kong, taking measures to crush opposition and limit political expression within the special administrative region. These efforts to control and eliminate dissent have had far-reaching implications for Hong Kong's civil society and political landscape.\n\nChina's approach to governance in Hong Kong, particularly its handling of dissent and political opposition, has drawn significant international criticism. The rights abuses occurring in Hong Kong under Chinese authority have led to widespread condemnation from Western countries. Chinese efforts to suppress political opposition and limit freedoms in Hong Kong have particularly riled Western nations, creating diplomatic tensions and prompting various forms of international criticism and, in some cases, sanctions.\n\nThe international response to China's actions in Hong Kong reflects broader concerns about the erosion of the \"One Country, Two Systems\" framework and the preservation of rights and freedoms that were promised to Hong Kong residents following the 1997 handover.
