Specifically, MA's personal office would send suggestions and communications to XI's top leadership via a party office. However, this communication appears to have been largely one-directional, as MA received replies only occasionally, suggesting limited reciprocal engagement from XI's leadership.\n\nThe relationship between MA and XI took a dramatic turn following a controversial speech delivered by MA. In response to this speech, XI acted swiftly and decisively, ordering regulators to investigate the Ant IPO (Initial Public Offering) within hours. This rapid regulatory action represented a significant exercise of authority by XI and resulted in what has been characterized as MA's public humbling—a notable shift in MA's public standing and influence.\n\nThis sequence of events illustrates the power dynamics between MA and XI, where XI demonstrated the capacity to mobilize regulatory apparatus quickly in response to perceived challenges or controversial statements. The investigation into the Ant IPO and its immediate timing relative to MA's speech suggests that XI's response was directly triggered by the content or tone of MA's public remarks.
