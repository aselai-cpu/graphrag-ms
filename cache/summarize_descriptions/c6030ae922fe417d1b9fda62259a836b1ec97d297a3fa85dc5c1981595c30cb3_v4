The publisher has established itself as a major contributor to scholarly literature on China and authoritarian political systems.\n\n## Major Publications\n\nCambridge University Press has published several influential academic works, including:\n\n- **The Cambridge History of China**, a comprehensive historical reference work\n- **\"Rethinking Chinese Politics\"** by Joseph Fewsmith\n- **\"Wealth into Power\"** by Bruce J. Dickson (2008), which examines China's Communist Party and the private sector\n- **\"The Politics of Authoritarian Rule\"** by Milan W.

The publisher initially acceded to Chinese government requests to remove hundreds of articles from its Chinese website. This decision sparked considerable backlash within the academic community, as it raised serious concerns about academic freedom and the integrity of scholarly publishing.\n\nFollowing widespread criticism, Cambridge University Press reversed its decision and restored the previously removed articles. This reversal demonstrated the publisher's ultimate commitment to academic freedom and resistance to censorship pressures, despite the potential commercial implications for its operations in the Chinese market.\n\n## Significance\n\nThe censorship incident highlighted the complex challenges that international academic publishers face when operating in markets with strict content controls. Cambridge University Press's initial compliance followed by its reversal became a notable case study in the tension between commercial interests and academic principles.\n\nAs a New York-based publisher (though primarily associated with Cambridge), Cambridge University Press continues to play a vital role in disseminating scholarly research on sensitive political topics, including authoritarian governance, corruption, and political economy in China and beyond.
