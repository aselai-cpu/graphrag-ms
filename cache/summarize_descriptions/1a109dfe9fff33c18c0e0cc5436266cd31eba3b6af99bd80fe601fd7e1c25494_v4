This powerful commission plays a central role in managing the country's security apparatus and legal system.\n\nThe commission holds significant authority over China's security forces and is responsible for coordinating law enforcement and judicial agencies throughout the country. Its broad mandate encompasses various aspects of internal security and the administration of justice, making it one of the most influential bodies within the Chinese political system.\n\nIn terms of its organizational structure and political standing, the commission has undergone notable changes under President Xi Jinping's leadership. The secretary position of the commission was previously held by a member of the Politburo Standing Committee, China's highest decision-making body. However, Xi downgraded this role from the Politburo Standing Committee to the broader Politburo, representing a significant shift in the commission's political status and influence within the party hierarchy.\n\nThe commission has been led by notable figures in Chinese politics, including Zhou Yongkang, who formerly headed the organization. Zhou's tenure represents a significant period in the commission's history, particularly given his subsequent fall from grace in one of China's most high-profile corruption cases.\n\nIn its operational capacity, the Central Political and Legal Affairs Commission has undertaken various initiatives to address issues within China's legal system. Notably, the commission has issued opinions aimed at rectifying the problem of judicial brokers—intermediaries who inappropriately influence legal proceedings. This demonstrates the commission's role in maintaining the integrity of China's judicial system and combating corruption within legal institutions.\n\nThe commission has also embraced modern communication methods to extend its reach and influence. It operates a WeChat account called \"Sword of Eternal Peace\" (Chang'an Jian), which serves as a platform for disseminating information and communicating the commission's positions on various security and legal matters to the public.\n\nOverall, the Central Political and Legal Affairs Commission remains a crucial institution within China's governance structure, despite the recent downgrading of its leadership position. It continues to exercise substantial influence over the country's security apparatus, law enforcement agencies, and judicial system, playing a vital role in maintaining internal stability and implementing the Party's policies related to security and legal affairs.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"citations": null, "thinking_blocks": null}}}], "created": 1769998252, "model": "claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 509, "prompt_tokens": 347, "total_tokens": 856, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": null, "audio_tokens": null, "reasoning_tokens": null, "rejected_prediction_tokens": null, "text_tokens": 509}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null, "cache_creation_tokens": 0, "cache_creation_token_details": {"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens": 0, "ephemeral_1h_input_tokens": 0}}, "cache_creation_input_tokens": 0, "cache_read_input_tokens": 0}, "formatted_response": null, "content": "# Central Political and Legal Affairs Commission\n\nThe Central Political and Legal Affairs Commission, commonly known as zhengfawei, is a prominent Chinese government body that serves as the Party's top organization overseeing internal security, law enforcement, judicial agencies, and political and legal affairs in China.
