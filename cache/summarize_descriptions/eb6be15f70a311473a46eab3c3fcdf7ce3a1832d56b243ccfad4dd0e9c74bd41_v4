This centralized governance structure allows the Party to direct national policies and administrative functions from this single location. Beijing represents the central government of the Communist Party, which has implemented various forms of centralized control, including authority over educational materials and teaching resources throughout the country.\n\n**Policy Formation and Implementation**\n\nFrom its base in Beijing, the Communist Party formulates and implements policies on critical national and international matters.
