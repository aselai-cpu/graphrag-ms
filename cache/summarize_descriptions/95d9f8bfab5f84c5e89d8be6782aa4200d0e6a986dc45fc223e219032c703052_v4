The \"709 Crackdown,\" named after its start date of July 9, 2015, represented one of the most severe suppressions of the legal rights defense movement in modern Chinese history. During her detention as part of this crackdown, Wang Yu was subjected to torture, and she later provided detailed accounts of her harrowing experiences, contributing important testimony about the treatment of political detainees and human rights defenders in China.\n\nHer experiences with state intimidation extended beyond formal detention. Wang Yu endured threatening incidents designed to instill fear and silence her advocacy work.
