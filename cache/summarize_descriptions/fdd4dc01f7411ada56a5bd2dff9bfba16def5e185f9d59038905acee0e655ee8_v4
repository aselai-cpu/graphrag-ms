This decision was significant as it broke with recent precedent in Chinese political tradition, where leaders typically designated their successors well in advance of their departure. By choosing not to promote a clear heir apparent to the Party's highest decision-making body, Xi Jinping signaled his intention to maintain control and potentially extend his tenure beyond the customary two-term limit. This move was widely interpreted as a consolidation of Xi Jinping's personal power within the Chinese political system.\n\nAdditionally, Xi Jinping oversaw a remarkable transformation in military representation at the 2017 Party Congress. Nearly 90 percent of the People's Liberation Army (PLA) delegates who attended the congress were first-time participants. This unprecedented turnover in military representation suggested a significant reshuffling of the PLA's leadership ranks and indicated Xi Jinping's efforts to reshape the military establishment. The high proportion of new delegates could reflect Xi Jinping's anti-corruption campaign within the military, his desire to install loyalists in key positions, or both. This dramatic change in PLA representation underscored Xi Jinping's focus on military reform and his determination to ensure the armed forces' loyalty to his leadership.\n\nThe 2017 Party Congress thus marked a pivotal moment in Xi Jinping's consolidation of power, characterized by both the absence of a designated successor and a substantial renewal of military representation.
