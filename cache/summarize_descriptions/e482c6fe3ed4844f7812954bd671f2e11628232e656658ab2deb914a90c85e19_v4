Deng Xiaoping personally chose Jiang Zemin as his heir and successor, making the critical decision to designate him as the next party chief. This succession represented a pivotal moment in Chinese political history.\n\nJiang Zemin succeeded Deng Xiaoping as party chief and demonstrated strong loyalty to his predecessor's vision and policies. He sided with Deng during critical political moments and took decisive action to enshrine Deng's reformist path as official policy, ensuring continuity in China's economic and political direction. Throughout his leadership, Jiang Zemin deviated little from Deng's doctrine of contrived modesty, maintaining the political style and approach that Deng had established.\n\nIn terms of policy implementation, Jiang Zemin proved to be a faithful follower of Deng's initiatives across multiple domains. He continued Deng's efforts to modernize the People's Liberation Army (PLA), advancing military reforms and development that his predecessor had initiated. Additionally, Jiang Zemin followed Deng's lead on legal reforms, maintaining consistency in the approach to China's evolving legal system.\n\nInterestingly, Jiang Zemin also adopted some of Deng's political tactics and strategies. In a move reminiscent of Deng's own power management style, Jiang Zemin employed a \"Deng-style power play\" when transitioning out of leadership. Specifically, he stayed on as chairman of the military commission for two additional years after stepping down as general secretary, mirroring the approach Deng had used to maintain influence during leadership transitions.\n\nThe relationship between these two leaders exemplifies a successful political succession in which the chosen successor not only assumed power smoothly but also remained committed to the predecessor's vision and methodology. Jiang Zemin's adherence to Deng Xiaoping's reformist policies, modest leadership style, and strategic political maneuvering ensured stability and continuity in Chinese governance during a critical period of the country's development.
