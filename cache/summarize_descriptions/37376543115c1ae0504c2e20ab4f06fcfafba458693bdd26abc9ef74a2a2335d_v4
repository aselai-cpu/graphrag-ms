As a former and historical leader of the CCP, Deng maintained political preeminence within the party until his death, demonstrating his enduring influence over Chinese politics and governance.\n\nThroughout his leadership tenure, Deng Xiaoping was instrumental in enriching the nation and implementing significant reforms.

This episode highlighted the complex nature of his legacy, balancing reform initiatives with firm party discipline.\n\nDeng's historical record within the CCP is not without complexity. As a senior member of the party, his role in the Anti-Rightist campaign—a political movement in the late 1950s that persecuted hundreds of thousands of intellectuals and party members—was notably elided or downplayed in official histories.
