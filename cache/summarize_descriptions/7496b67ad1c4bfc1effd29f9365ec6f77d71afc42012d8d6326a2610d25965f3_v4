She has written extensively about the importance of \"raising discourse power\" by \"telling China's stories well,\" emphasizing the need for China to improve its international narrative and communication effectiveness. This concept reflects her belief in the strategic importance of shaping global perceptions of China through more effective public diplomacy and storytelling.\n\nNotably, Fu Ying has expressed reservations about the so-called \"wolf warrior diplomacy\" approach that has characterized some aspects of Chinese foreign policy in recent years. Wolf warrior diplomacy refers to a more aggressive, confrontational style of Chinese diplomatic communication that emerged prominently in the late 2010s and early 2020s. Her concerns about this approach suggest she advocates for a more measured and sophisticated diplomatic strategy.\n\nFu Ying has used prominent platforms to share her views on international discourse and diplomacy, including writing op-eds for the People's Daily, the official newspaper of the Chinese Communist Party's Central Committee.
