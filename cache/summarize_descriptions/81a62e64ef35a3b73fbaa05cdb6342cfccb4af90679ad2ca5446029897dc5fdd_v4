In this work, she documented the interactions and confrontations between these two world leaders during a critical period of U.S.-China relations.\n\nThroughout her reporting career, Lingling Wei has produced extensive coverage of Xi Jinping's economic policies and his socialist vision for China. She has written multiple articles analyzing how Xi Jinping has exercised control over the private sector, marking a significant shift in China's approach to its market economy. Her reporting has delved into Xi Jinping's approach to markets and economic policy, providing insights into how the Chinese leader has sought to balance economic growth with increased state control and ideological objectives.\n\nWei has also reported on Xi Jinping's power consolidation efforts, documenting how he has centralized authority and strengthened his position within the Chinese Communist Party and the broader governmental structure. This reporting has helped international audiences understand the mechanisms through which Xi Jinping has become one of China's most powerful leaders in recent decades.\n\nOne notable area of Wei's reporting involved Xi Jinping's role in halting the initial public offering (IPO) of Ant Group, the financial technology company affiliated with Alibaba founder Jack Ma.
