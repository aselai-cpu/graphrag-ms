As a historical sage, his philosophical doctrines have shaped Chinese society for millennia, establishing foundational principles that continue to resonate in modern times.\n\nIn contemporary China, Confucius has experienced a significant revival under President Xi Jinping's leadership. Xi has actively promoted Confucian thought as a means to instill pride in Chinese civilization and cultural heritage among the population. This represents a deliberate effort to reconnect with traditional Chinese values and philosophy, a shift that has been documented by major international media outlets, including the Wall Street Journal, which has reported on China's renewed embrace of Confucian teachings.\n\nXi Jinping's promotion of Confucius serves multiple political and social purposes. The ancient sage is celebrated as a tool to inspire virtue and moral conduct among government officials, with his teachings being used to establish ethical standards for public servants. Additionally, Confucian philosophy has been employed to provide philosophical justification for authoritarian governance structures, drawing on traditional concepts of hierarchical order and social harmony that are inherent in Confucian thought.\n\nThis modern revival of Confucianism represents a dramatic reversal from earlier periods in Chinese history. Most notably, during Mao Zedong's era, Confucius was condemned and rejected as a feudal relic representing backward, pre-revolutionary thinking. Mao's Cultural Revolution actively sought to eliminate Confucian influence, viewing it as incompatible with communist ideology and an obstacle to revolutionary progress. The contrast between Mao's denunciation and Xi's celebration of Confucius illustrates the shifting political uses of traditional philosophy in China's governance.\n\nThe rehabilitation of Confucius in contemporary Chinese political discourse reflects broader trends in the Chinese government's approach to cultural identity and legitimacy. By embracing this ancient philosopher, the current leadership seeks to establish continuity with China's historical greatness while simultaneously using traditional values to reinforce modern political objectives. This strategic deployment of Confucian thought demonstrates how classical philosophy can be reinterpreted and repurposed to serve contemporary political needs, bridging thousands of years of Chinese history with present-day governance challenges.\n\nOverall, Confucius remains a pivotal figure whose legacy continues to evolve, serving as both a symbol of Chinese cultural achievement and a practical tool for shaping modern Chinese society and political culture.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"citations": null, "thinking_blocks": null}}}], "created": 1769998247, "model": "claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 537, "prompt_tokens": 252, "total_tokens": 789, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": null, "audio_tokens": null, "reasoning_tokens": null, "rejected_prediction_tokens": null, "text_tokens": 537}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null, "cache_creation_tokens": 0, "cache_creation_token_details": {"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens": 0, "ephemeral_1h_input_tokens": 0}}, "cache_creation_input_tokens": 0, "cache_read_input_tokens": 0}, "formatted_response": null, "content": "# Comprehensive Summary: Confucius\n\nConfucius is an ancient Chinese philosopher and classical thinker whose teachings have profoundly influenced Chinese culture, governance, and civilization throughout history.
