At the time of their marriage, she was nine years his junior and notably more famous than her husband, having established herself as a popular folk singer in the People's Liberation Army (PLA). Her career as a songstress included extensive tours, and the couple maintained their relationship through daily phone calls during her travels. Peng has openly discussed her married life in interviews, providing glimpses into their personal relationship.\n\nAs China's First Lady, Peng Liyuan has distinguished herself from previous Chinese first ladies of the post-Mao era by embracing a much more public role rather than maintaining the publicity shyness that characterized her predecessors. She has added significant star power to Xi Jinping's political image through her celebrity status and charismatic presence. Her approach to the role has been notably modern and engaged, marking a departure from traditional expectations of Chinese political spouses.\n\nPeng Liyuan has been particularly active in charitable and humanitarian work. She serves as a goodwill ambassador for HIV/AIDS prevention, using her platform and fame to raise awareness about this critical public health issue. Beyond this specific cause, she has maintained an active schedule of charity work, demonstrating a commitment to social causes and public service.\n\nIn her capacity as First Lady, Peng has accompanied Xi Jinping on numerous diplomatic engagements, where her presence and star quality have enhanced China's soft power on the international stage.
