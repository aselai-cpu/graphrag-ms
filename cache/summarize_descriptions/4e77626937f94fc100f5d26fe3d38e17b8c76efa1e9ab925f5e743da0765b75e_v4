Beyond Alibaba, Ma also established Hupan University in Hangzhou, further extending his influence in China's business and educational spheres.\n\nMa's relationship with Chinese authorities and the Communist Party, particularly with Xi Jinping, underwent a dramatic transformation. He had interactions with Xi Jinping regarding private sector policies and maintained communication channels with party leadership through Xi's office. However, this relationship deteriorated significantly following a controversial speech in which Ma criticized China's financial establishment and regulators. This speech proved to be a turning point in his fortunes.\n\nThe fallout from Ma's criticism was swift and severe. The highly anticipated initial public offering (IPO) of Ant Group, Alibaba's financial technology affiliate, was abruptly suspended.
