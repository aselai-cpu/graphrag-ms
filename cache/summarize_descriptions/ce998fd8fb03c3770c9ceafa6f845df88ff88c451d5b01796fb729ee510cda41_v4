This competition has intensified in recent years, with bipartisan support emerging for tougher China policies, marking a significant shift from decades of engagement with Beijing.\n\n**Military and Security Relations**\n\nThe United States maintains extensive military involvement in the Asia-Pacific region, sending warships to challenge China's territorial claims in the South China Sea and maintaining security alliances throughout Asia. The U.S. provides substantial military support and arms to Taiwan, conducts training operations, and maintains a policy of strategic ambiguity regarding whether it would defend Taiwan against Chinese attack. The Department of Defense actively monitors China's military developments and supplies weapons to Taiwan. The U.S. has experienced unsafe or unprofessional encounters with Chinese forces, including interceptions of American spy planes by Chinese fighters. Historically, the U.S. led forces in the Korean War, including participation in the Battle of Chosin Reservoir.\n\n**Economic and Trade Relations**\n\nThe United States is engaged in a significant trade war with China, involving disputes over technology, tariffs, and trade practices. The U.S. has implemented semiconductor export restrictions and other technological controls aimed at limiting China's advancement. These tensions have spurred China's push for self-sufficiency and technological supremacy. American companies face pressure regarding their China operations, and U.S. airlines have had to meet Beijing's requirements on describing Taiwan. The U.S. passed legislation banning imports from Xinjiang and has been involved in negotiations with China on various commercial matters, including Disney operations.\n\n**Diplomatic Relations**\n\nDespite ongoing tensions, the United States maintains complex diplomatic and economic relations with China, including cybersecurity agreements alongside numerous disputes. High-level diplomatic engagement continues, with historical visits including Vice President Joe Biden's 2011 trip to China and meetings between Chinese leadership and former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger. However, relations have been strained by various incidents, including the U.S. government's sanctions on Beijing following the Tiananmen Square protests, the accidental bombing of the Chinese embassy in Belgrade, and diplomatic conflicts at forums like APEC 2018.\n\n**Chinese Perspectives**\n\nFrom China's perspective, Xi Jinping has described the United States as the biggest source of chaos and threat to China's development and security. Chinese officials, including Zhao Lijian, have promoted conspiracy theories targeting the U.S. The Chinese Academy of History has criticized aspects of American history, including the cotton industry's foundation on slavery and issues involving black slaves, while China characterizes the U.S. as a nation of individualism, hedonism, and democracy.\n\n**Other Connections**\n\nThe United States has strengthened ties with Taiwan and other democracies in response to China's aggressive posturing. China replaced the U.S. as Taiwan's most important trading partner following the Kosovo War intervention. The U.S. maintains military cooperation with Singapore without formal alliance. Domestically, the U.S. has a defined line of succession under the Presidential Succession Act and 25th Amendment, with anti-corruption responsibilities distributed across multiple agencies. China has criticized the U.S. for gun violence and racial injustice, while Chinese intelligence operations have targeted the U.S., including cases like Dickson Yeo acting as an illegal agent.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"citations": null, "thinking_blocks": null}}}], "created": 1769998157, "model": "claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 725, "prompt_tokens": 1141, "total_tokens": 1866, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": null, "audio_tokens": null, "reasoning_tokens": null, "rejected_prediction_tokens": null, "text_tokens": 725}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null, "cache_creation_tokens": 0, "cache_creation_token_details": {"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens": 0, "ephemeral_1h_input_tokens": 0}}, "cache_creation_input_tokens": 0, "cache_read_input_tokens": 0}, "formatted_response": null, "content": "# UNITED STATES\n\nThe United States is a superpower engaged in comprehensive strategic competition with China across economic, military, diplomatic, and technological fronts.
