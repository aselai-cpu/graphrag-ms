Throughout their reporting career, Fan has demonstrated a focus on critical issues affecting Chinese governance, civil liberties, and regional security.\n\nAs a Wall Street Journal correspondent, Wenxin Fan has co-authored multiple high-profile articles on sensitive topics. Fan reported on China's military activities around Taiwan, including co-authoring an article specifically covering China's live-fire drills around Taiwan, highlighting the escalating tensions in the Taiwan Strait and Beijing's military posturing in the region.\n\nFan has also investigated and reported on China's domestic surveillance and control mechanisms. This includes co-authoring a Wall Street Journal article about China's DNA database, which relates to the country's expanding biometric surveillance infrastructure. Additionally, Fan reported on how protesters were thwarted by red health codes, exposing how China's COVID-19 health tracking system was allegedly weaponized to suppress dissent and limit citizens' freedom of movement during periods of social unrest.\n\nIn covering pro-democracy movements, Wenxin Fan co-authored an article for the Wall Street Journal about Hong Kong marchers and the controversial extradition bill. This reporting captured a pivotal moment in Hong Kong's recent history, when massive protests erupted in 2019 against proposed legislation that would have allowed extraditions to mainland China, sparking widespread concerns about the erosion of Hong Kong's autonomy and civil liberties.\n\nBeyond their investigative journalism, Wenxin Fan has also been noted for offering advice and encouragement, suggesting a mentorship or supportive role within journalistic circles or to sources and colleagues.\n\nOverall, Wenxin Fan's body of work reflects a commitment to covering some of the most challenging and politically sensitive stories in contemporary China and East Asia.
