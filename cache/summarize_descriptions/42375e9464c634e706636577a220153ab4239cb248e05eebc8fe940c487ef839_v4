Throughout his career and in retirement, he has been a prominent voice on Singapore's foreign relations, particularly regarding China and regional geopolitics.\n\nKausikan is notably outspoken about Singapore's relationship with China and has publicly defended Singapore's stance against Beijing. He gained attention for his Facebook comments addressing Singapore's relations with China, emphasizing that Singapore should not be intimidated by Beijing. His commentary reflects a firm position on maintaining Singapore's sovereignty and independent foreign policy despite pressure from larger powers.\n\nIn his analysis of China's diplomatic approach, Kausikan has been particularly critical, describing Beijing's methods as an \"almost Pavlovian process of conditioning.\" This characterization suggests his view that China employs systematic pressure tactics to influence smaller nations' behavior and policy decisions.\n\nKausikan has also weighed in on specific cases involving Singapore-China relations, including commenting on the Dickson Yeo case and its connection to Huang Jing on Facebook. These interventions demonstrate his continued engagement with contemporary security and diplomatic issues affecting Singapore, even after his retirement from official government service.\n\nBeyond bilateral relations with China, Kausikan has contributed to broader regional discussions as a speaker and thought leader. He has delivered lectures on ASEAN and the dynamics of US-China competition in Southeast Asia, sharing his expertise on how smaller Southeast Asian nations navigate the strategic rivalry between the two superpowers. His insights are particularly valuable given his extensive experience in Singapore's foreign ministry and his deep understanding of regional diplomacy.\n\nAs a government official during his active service and as a commentator in retirement, Kausikan represents a pragmatic and assertive approach to Singapore's foreign policy. His willingness to publicly articulate positions that may be sensitive, particularly regarding relations with China, has made him a significant figure in discussions about Southeast Asian diplomacy and the region's response to great power competition. His perspectives continue to influence discourse on how small states can maintain their autonomy and interests while managing relationships with much larger and more powerful neighbors.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"citations": null, "thinking_blocks": null}}}], "created": 1769998357, "model": "claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 471, "prompt_tokens": 325, "total_tokens": 796, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": null, "audio_tokens": null, "reasoning_tokens": null, "rejected_prediction_tokens": null, "text_tokens": 471}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null, "cache_creation_tokens": 0, "cache_creation_token_details": {"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens": 0, "ephemeral_1h_input_tokens": 0}}, "cache_creation_input_tokens": 0, "cache_read_input_tokens": 0}, "formatted_response": null, "content": "# Bilahari Kausikan - Comprehensive Summary\n\nBilahari Kausikan is a retired Singaporean diplomat who served as the Singapore foreign ministry's top civil servant from 2010 to 2013.
