As the country's legislature, it consists of nearly three thousand lawmakers representing diverse sectors of Chinese society, including officials, soldiers, entrepreneurs, scholars, workers, and villagers who convene annually to deliberate on state affairs.\n\nThe NPC has played a significant role during Xi Jinping's leadership, demonstrating increased legislative activity and serving as a platform for major political developments. During Xi's first decade in power, the NPC passed bills at an unprecedented pace, averaging close to double the number of bills per year compared to the legislative output during Hu Jintao's second term. This acceleration in legislative activity reflects the broader transformation of China's governance structure under Xi's administration.\n\nSeveral notable events mark the NPC's recent history. In March 2013, the NPC held its 12th session where Xi Jinping delivered a speech, marking an important moment in his early leadership. The body celebrated its 60th anniversary, at which Xi Jinping also gave a speech, highlighting the institution's historical significance within China's political system.\n\nOne of the most consequential actions taken by the NPC occurred in March 2018, when it voted on constitutional changes with 2,964 delegates present. This session approved the removal of presidential term limits with a 99.8 percent approval rate, a decision that fundamentally altered China's political landscape by enabling Xi Jinping to remain in power beyond the traditional two-term limit.\n\nThe NPC's legislative functions extend across various domains of governance. The body has published significant legal documents, including the Amendment to the Criminal Law of the People's Republic of China, demonstrating its role in shaping China's legal framework. Additionally, the NPC has published reports on state asset management and content related to political and legal work through its official website, reflecting its involvement in economic oversight and legal affairs.\n\nThe relationship between the NPC and the Communist Party is fundamental to understanding its function. While formally China's legislature, the NPC operates within the framework of Party control, serving as an instrument through which the Communist Party implements its policies and legitimizes its decisions through legislative processes. This structure ensures that the NPC's actions align with the Party's strategic objectives while maintaining the appearance of representative governance through its diverse membership base.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"citations": null, "thinking_blocks": null}}}], "created": 1769998156, "model": "claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 510, "prompt_tokens": 479, "total_tokens": 989, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": null, "audio_tokens": null, "reasoning_tokens": null, "rejected_prediction_tokens": null, "text_tokens": 510}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null, "cache_creation_tokens": 0, "cache_creation_token_details": {"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens": 0, "ephemeral_1h_input_tokens": 0}}, "cache_creation_input_tokens": 0, "cache_read_input_tokens": 0}, "formatted_response": null, "content": "# National People's Congress - Comprehensive Summary\n\nThe National People's Congress (NPC) is China's legislative body and primary governmental institution, operating under the control of the Communist Party.
