The newspaper has provided extensive coverage of Xi Jinping's policies, leadership style, and governance approach during his tenure as China's paramount leader.\n\nAmong the notable investigative journalism conducted by the New York Times was reporting on Xi Jinping's relatives and their financial activities. Specifically, the newspaper reported that Xi Jinping's relatives were shedding assets during his widely publicized anti-corruption campaign, also known as the anti-graft campaign. This reporting highlighted a potentially sensitive intersection between Xi's public political initiatives to combat corruption within the Chinese Communist Party and the private financial dealings of his own family members. Such coverage raised questions about transparency and potential conflicts of interest at the highest levels of Chinese leadership.\n\nAdditionally, the New York Times gained access to leaked internal Chinese Communist Party documents that contained statements made by Xi Jinping. These leaked documents provided the newspaper with insider perspectives on Xi's directives, thinking, and communications within the party apparatus—information that would typically remain confidential within China's political system. The publication of materials based on these leaked documents represents significant investigative journalism that offered international audiences rare insights into the internal workings of the Chinese government and Xi Jinping's leadership approach.\n\nThrough these various reporting efforts, the New York Times has established itself as an important source of information regarding Xi Jinping's administration, covering both his public policies and leadership initiatives as well as more sensitive matters involving his family's financial activities and internal party communications.
