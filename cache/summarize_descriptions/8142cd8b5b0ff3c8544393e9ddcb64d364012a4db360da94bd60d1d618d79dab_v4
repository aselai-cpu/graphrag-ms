This institution has played a significant role in both tracking financial crimes and implementing crucial economic reforms.\n\nIn 2008, the Central Bank released an important report that shed light on a serious issue facing China: corrupt officials fleeing the country with substantial assets. This report highlighted the problem of capital flight associated with corruption, bringing attention to officials who had absconded abroad while taking illicit funds with them. The release of this report demonstrated the Central Bank's role in monitoring and documenting financial irregularities and corruption-related capital movements.\n\nBeyond its oversight functions, the Central Bank has been instrumental in managing China's currency policy, particularly regarding the yuan (also known as the renminbi). The institution has implemented significant policy changes to control the value and flow of China's currency. Notably, the Central Bank loosened controls on the yuan, representing a move toward greater currency flexibility and market-driven exchange rates.
