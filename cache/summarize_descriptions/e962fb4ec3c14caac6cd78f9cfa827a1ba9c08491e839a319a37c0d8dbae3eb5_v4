His career trajectory demonstrates a long-standing connection to Chinese leadership and a consistent presence in key diplomatic moments.\n\nYang's early career began as a young foreign ministry official when he joined Geng Biao's delegation during a historic 1979 European tour. Notably, Xi Jinping was also part of this delegation, establishing a professional relationship that would span decades and prove significant for Yang's later career advancement.\n\nYang served as China's foreign minister and gained international attention for his forceful diplomatic style at the 2010 ASEAN Regional Forum in Hanoi. At this gathering, he responded with a tirade that marked a notable shift in China's diplomatic approach. This outburst is credited with contributing to Washington's decision to adopt a firmer stance toward China, representing a turning point in U.S.-China relations during that period.\n\nFollowing his tenure as foreign minister, Yang's career continued to ascend within China's political hierarchy. In 2017, he joined the Politburo, one of the most powerful decision-making bodies in China. He subsequently became Xi Jinping's top foreign policy adviser and was appointed as the Director of the Office of the Central Commission for Foreign Affairs, positioning him at the apex of China's foreign policy apparatus.\n\nYang continued to demonstrate his assertive diplomatic style in 2021 when he met with U.S. officials in Anchorage, Alaska. During this high-profile meeting, which was intended to address tensions between the two nations, Yang berated American officials in a lengthy opening statement. He used the platform to tout China's political system while simultaneously criticizing the United States, an approach that drew significant international media attention and further exemplified the deteriorating state of U.S.-China relations.\n\nThroughout his career, Yang Jiechi has been characterized by his willingness to adopt a confrontational stance in defense of Chinese interests and the Chinese political system. His progression from a young foreign ministry official to a Politburo member and Xi Jinping's chief foreign policy adviser reflects both his diplomatic capabilities and his alignment with China's increasingly assertive foreign policy posture under Xi's leadership.
