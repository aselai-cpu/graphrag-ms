Born as the son of a low-level official, Li Keqiang distinguished himself academically as a Peking University graduate with a law degree and a PhD in economics. He was also noted as a fluent English speaker, which set him apart among Chinese leadership.\n\nLi Keqiang's political career included work with the Communist Youth League and service in Henan and Liaoning provinces before ascending to national leadership. He was positioned as Xi Jinping's main rival for fifth-generation leadership, being two years junior to Xi as a provincial party boss. This rivalry would later manifest in their relationship at the highest levels of government.\n\nAs Premier, Li Keqiang championed significant economic reforms focused on liberalizing China's economy. He led an early and vigorous charge to boost private industry while slimming down the bloated state sector. His reform agenda included reducing taxes, cutting red tape, providing more credit to businesses, and developing the financial sector. He made promises to help entrepreneurs and was a strong advocate for market-based reforms of state-owned enterprises (SOEs). These initiatives reflected his commitment to economic modernization and private sector development.\n\nLi Keqiang maintained an active presence in both domestic and international affairs. In 2014, he gave speeches at the Second Central Xinjiang Work Forum, addressing important regional policy matters. In the summer of 2016, he represented China at a gathering of Asian and European leaders in Mongolia, demonstrating his role in international diplomacy.\n\nHowever, Li Keqiang's tenure was marked by increasing political tensions and marginalization. He experienced notable discord with Xi Jinping, which affected his political standing and influence. His power over policy-making was significantly reduced, particularly following Liu He's appointment to key economic positions. Xi Jinping progressively sidelined Li Keqiang, diminishing his role despite his position as Premier. This sidelining raised questions about Li Keqiang's political future and reflected broader power consolidation by Xi Jinping.\n\nThe relationship between Li Keqiang and Xi Jinping represented a significant dynamic in contemporary Chinese politics, with Li's market-oriented reform agenda sometimes at odds with Xi's approach to governance.
