The international response to China's treatment of Muslim minorities in the region has created diplomatic tensions and drawn condemnation from Western nations and human rights organizations.\n\nThe issue has become sufficiently sensitive that Chinese President Xi Jinping has made it a priority for Chinese diplomats to actively enforce Communist Party narratives regarding the situation in Xinjiang.
