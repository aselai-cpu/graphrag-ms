Historically, Japan played a significant role as a colonial and imperial power in the region. The country received Taiwan from the Qing empire following the Sino-Japanese War and ruled it as a colony for five decades until the end of World War II. During the 1930s and 1940s, Japan was portrayed as a foreign imperialist that bullied China, with its troops perpetrating the infamous 1937 Nanjing Massacre. The Yellow River Cantata was written to resist Japanese invaders during this period. China commemorates the war against Japan through various museums and monuments, and Japan's surrender at the end of World War II was notably commemorated by China's 2015 military parade.\n\nIn the post-war era, Japan emerged as a major economic power and regional player. China eventually leapfrogged Japan economically to become the world's second-biggest economy, marking a significant shift in regional economic dynamics. Despite historical tensions, Japan has maintained academic and cultural exchanges, with Chinese and foreign academics meeting in the country to continue research collaborations. Japanese pop culture has also gained influence among younger Singaporeans, demonstrating its soft power reach.\n\nContemporary Japan-China relations remain complex and often contentious. Territorial disputes have been a significant source of tension, particularly regarding islands in the East China Sea that Japan claimed in the 1890s and has administered since 1972. These disputes have sparked nationalist anger in China, with Japanese companies facing backlash over territorial disagreements and Tokyo's posture on wartime atrocities. Japan conducts fighter jet scrambles in response to PLA warplane sorties near its territory, reflecting ongoing military tensions.\n\nJapan maintains a strong security alliance with the United States and hosts a U.S. military base in Djibouti. As a U.S. ally, Japan is involved in potential trilateral military alliance discussions with the United States and South Korea. Influential voices within Japan have called for increased security cooperation with the U.S. and Taiwan to deter China, reflecting concerns about regional security dynamics.\n\nThe country also engages in diplomatic efforts, with a former Japanese Prime Minister meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping at Xingguo Hotel, demonstrating ongoing high-level diplomatic engagement despite tensions. Japan is mentioned as a trading partner of South Korea and a regional power with which the U.S. strengthened ties as part of the pivot to Asia strategy.
