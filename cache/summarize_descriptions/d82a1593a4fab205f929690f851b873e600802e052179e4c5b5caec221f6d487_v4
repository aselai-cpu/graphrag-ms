The city gained international attention in July 2009 when violent riots erupted between Uyghurs and Han Chinese, resulting in approximately two hundred deaths and more than seventeen hundred injuries, marking one of the most serious ethnic conflicts in modern Chinese history.\n\nIn response to ongoing security challenges, Urumqi has become heavily fortified with an extensive surveillance and policing infrastructure. Hundreds of small police stations now blanket the city as part of comprehensive stability-maintenance efforts. The city serves as a focal point for high-level security inspections, notably when Chen Quanguo visited shortly after his arrival in the region to inspect stability-maintenance work at a police command center. This visit underscores the city's strategic importance in regional security operations.\n\nThe security situation in Urumqi deteriorated further in 2014 when the city experienced a series of violent attacks, including suicide bombings and market attacks that killed and wounded numerous people. These incidents contributed to the intensification of security measures throughout the region and influenced government policies toward maintaining stability in Xinjiang.\n\nDespite the security challenges, Urumqi has continued to develop as a commercial center. In late 2021, Tesla opened a showroom in the city, demonstrating that international businesses continue to view Urumqi as an important market within Xinjiang and western China. This commercial development reflects the city's dual nature as both a security focal point and an economic hub in the region.\n\nAs the regional capital, Urumqi serves as the administrative, economic, and cultural center of Xinjiang. The city's strategic location and status make it a critical site for government officials to demonstrate control and implement policies related to regional stability. The extensive police presence and command infrastructure established in Urumqi represent the government's approach to managing ethnic tensions and preventing further violence in the region.\n\nThe city's recent history illustrates the complex challenges facing Xinjiang, balancing security concerns with economic development, while managing the delicate relationship between different ethnic communities.
