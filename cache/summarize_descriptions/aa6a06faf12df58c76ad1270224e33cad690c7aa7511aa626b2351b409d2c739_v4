Founded in 1921 as an underground group of approximately fifty people, it has evolved into a sprawling bureaucracy with more than 96 million members (some sources cite over 85 million), reaching into every corner of Chinese society.\n\n## Historical Development\n\nThe party was born after the Qing dynasty's collapse and experienced numerous leadership changes in its early decades, with Mao Zedong seizing effective control in 1935. After taking power in 1949, the party initially pledged to build a \"united front\" with noncommunist groups but later crushed the private sector by the late 1950s. The party fanned anger against Western imperialism and waged war against perceived U.S. aggression. Following the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests and subsequent loss of faith in Marxism-Leninism, the party ramped up patriotic education in the early 1990s and centralized control over teaching materials. The party marked its 100th anniversary in 2021.\n\n## Structure and Governance\n\nAs a Leninist party, the CCP operates as a hierarchical, mobilizational, and task-oriented organization with a secretive system. It maintains a governing charter, holds national congresses, and includes various leadership positions including general secretary and military commission chairman. The party controls the National People's Congress, commands the People's Liberation Army (PLA) as its armed wing, and exercises prerogative over the legal system, insisting that law is a lever of state power rather than a restraint. It establishes party committees and cells within Chinese companies and foreign enterprises operating in China, requiring businesses to conform with its interests.\n\n## Xi Jinping's Leadership\n\nXi Jinping became general secretary and has demanded the party become stronger and more loyal to its leadership. He chairs various commissions that have centralized diplomatic decision-making and controls historical narratives to legitimize authoritarian rule. Xi applied to join the party ten times before becoming a member in January 1974, and was elevated into the Central Committee in fall 2022. Under his leadership, the party embraces nationalism, claims to lead an existential quest for national dignity and dominance, and has cleansed and reformed the organization through a system of discipline inspectors.\n\n## Contemporary Challenges and Policies\n\nThe party maintains a complete political monopoly over Chinese society while grappling with internal strife, ideological cleavages, corruption, and challenges to its authority. It uses ideological control, propaganda, extensive censorship, and digital authoritarianism as core tools of governance. The party has implemented controversial policies including forcible assimilation of Muslim minorities in Xinjiang through mass detention facilities, imposed national security law on Hong Kong, and maintains its claim over Taiwan. Despite diluting socialist ideals in the early 2000s, the party continues to control the economy, markets, and state institutions while presenting itself as the savior of the Chinese people.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"citations": null, "thinking_blocks": null}}}], "created": 1769998137, "model": "claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 674, "prompt_tokens": 2271, "total_tokens": 2945, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": null, "audio_tokens": null, "reasoning_tokens": null, "rejected_prediction_tokens": null, "text_tokens": 674}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null, "cache_creation_tokens": 0, "cache_creation_token_details": {"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens": 0, "ephemeral_1h_input_tokens": 0}}, "cache_creation_input_tokens": 0, "cache_read_input_tokens": 0}, "formatted_response": null, "content": "# COMMUNIST PARTY\n\nThe Communist Party, officially the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), is China's ruling political organization that has governed the country since seizing power on the mainland in 1949.
