Notably, the platform published Xi Jinping's speech from the Sixth Plenary Session, making this important political address available to the public. The publication included the full text of Xi Jinping's speech, ensuring complete and comprehensive access to his remarks from this significant political gathering. The Sixth Plenary Session represents an important event in Chinese political life, and Xinhua Net's role in disseminating the complete text underscores its function as an official channel for party communications.\n\nBeyond publishing speeches from formal sessions, Xinhua Net also reported on Xi Jinping's inspection activities and related statements.
