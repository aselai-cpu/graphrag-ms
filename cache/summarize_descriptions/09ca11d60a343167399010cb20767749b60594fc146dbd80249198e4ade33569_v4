As the Communist Party's primary watchdog agency, the CCDI investigates corruption and political misconduct among party members, operating as a formidable instrument of party control.\n\nThe CCDI functions largely outside China's formal legal system, possessing extraordinary powers that include the ability to seize evidence without warrants and detain suspects indefinitely through the shuanggui detention process. The organization adjudicates cases in secret and maintains comprehensive supervisory authority over party members at all levels. It operates inspection teams throughout the country and runs a website for receiving tip-offs from the public about official misconduct.\n\nHistorically associated with Mao Zedong, the CCDI absorbed the supervision ministry in 1993, consolidating its authority over party discipline. However, the organization has undergone significant transformation under Xi Jinping's leadership. Under Xi, the CCDI has evolved from primarily an anti-corruption body into an omnipresent tool of governance that enforces loyalty to the paramount leader himself. It has become what some describe as an ideological inquisitor, conducting political health checks on officials and punishing deviations from Xi's directives.\n\nThe organization's structure has been reformed to separate the powers of investigation, case review, and punishment, creating a system of internal checks within the agency. The CCDI's investigative staff also \"double-hat\" as government inspectors in the National Supervisory Commission, extending their reach beyond party members into the broader government apparatus.\n\nUnder Xi's leadership, the CCDI's authority has been both expanded and centralized. For investigations and punishments of officials at vice-ministerial rank or higher, the CCDI must secure Xi's personal approval, demonstrating the paramount leader's direct control over high-level disciplinary actions. Xi has directly addressed senior CCDI officials about ensuring that cadres do not act without instructions, and the organization has been specifically tasked with curbing formalism within the party.\n\nThe CCDI represents a critical pillar of Xi Jinping's governance model, transforming from a traditional anti-corruption agency into a comprehensive instrument for enforcing political discipline, ideological conformity, and personal loyalty to Xi himself.
