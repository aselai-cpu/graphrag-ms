His expertise and position within the Chinese Communist Party academic establishment have positioned him as an authoritative voice on matters of national reunification and China's long-term development objectives.\n\nIn November 2017, Xie Chuntao delivered remarks at a briefing in Beijing that was attended by both journalists and diplomats, providing insights into China's strategic thinking on critical national issues. During this briefing and in his broader commentary, he addressed the relationship between Taiwan unification and China's ambitions to achieve the status of a modern socialist power.\n\nSpecifically, Xie Chuntao has suggested that the resolution of the Taiwan issue would need to be accomplished by the mid-twenty-first century for China to be genuinely considered a modern socialist power. This timeline aligns with the Chinese Communist Party's broader \"Two Centenary Goals\" and indicates that party academics view Taiwan reunification not merely as a territorial or sovereignty issue, but as an integral component of China's national rejuvenation and its transformation into a fully developed modern socialist state.\n\nHis commentary reflects the official Chinese position that views Taiwan as an inseparable part of China and frames reunification as essential to the completion of China's national development trajectory. By linking the Taiwan question to China's status as a modern socialist power, Xie Chuntao underscores the ideological and strategic importance that the Chinese leadership places on resolving what it considers to be unfinished business from the Chinese Civil War.\n\nXie Chuntao's statements have been documented and referenced in scholarly and policy literature, with his views appearing in texts with specific page references (notably page 202 in at least one source), indicating that his perspectives are considered significant enough to be cited in academic and analytical works on Chinese policy toward Taiwan and China's long-term strategic planning.\n\nAs a senior party academic, Xie Chuntao serves as an important interpreter and communicator of Chinese Communist Party policy, helping to articulate the party's vision both to domestic audiences and to international observers through briefings and public commentary.
