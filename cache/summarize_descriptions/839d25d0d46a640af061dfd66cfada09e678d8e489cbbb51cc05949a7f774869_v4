Joe appears to be directly involved in handling or discussing Scrooge's possessions, particularly his bed-curtains, which suggests a significant involvement in Scrooge's affairs during what appears to be a critical moment.\n\nThe nature of their relationship is characterized by a deeply troubling scenario in which Joe is engaged in purchasing stolen goods that have been taken from a corpse. Scrooge witnesses these transactions and responds with intense negative emotions, specifically detestation and disgust, as he observes Joe buying these ill-gotten items.\n\nThis interaction suggests a scene where Scrooge is either witnessing the aftermath of his own death or observing how his belongings are being handled after his passing. The bed-curtains and other belongings that Joe discusses or acquires appear to have been stolen from Scrooge's corpse, indicating that Joe is participating in the macabre practice of profiting from the dead.
