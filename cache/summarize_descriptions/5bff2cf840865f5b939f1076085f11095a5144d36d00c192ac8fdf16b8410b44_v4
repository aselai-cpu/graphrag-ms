The two countries established formal diplomatic relations, with the 50th anniversary of this relationship commemorated in 2014.\n\nFrance holds particular importance in China's diplomatic history and economic rise. China leapfrogged France economically to become the world's second-biggest economy, marking a significant milestone in global economic rankings. Historically, France was involved in post-Korean War talks in Geneva, where French representatives negotiated against Zhou Enlai and his team.\n\n**Xi Jinping's Engagement with France**\n\nChinese President Xi Jinping has demonstrated a notable affinity for France and French culture. During a 2014 visit to France, he boasted about his knowledge of French intellectual tradition, citing his reading of prominent French writers and philosophers including Montesquieu, Voltaire, Rousseau, Diderot, and Sartre. Xi returned to France in early 2019, visiting iconic locations such as the Arc de Triomphe and Villa Kérylos in March of that year. During this visit, he held talks with French President Emmanuel Macron. Additionally, Ma, a Chinese official, met with then-French President François Hollande during another diplomatic engagement.\n\n**Lu Shaye's Ambassadorship and Diplomatic Tensions**\n\nLu Shaye served as Chinese Ambassador to France, a position from which he engaged in various diplomatic activities that occasionally sparked controversy. His tenure was marked by several incidents that strained Franco-Chinese relations. Lu Shaye became involved in disputes with French researchers and faced criticism for his diplomatic conduct. During the Covid-19 pandemic, diplomatic tensions escalated significantly when French media outlets questioned China's pandemic response. The French foreign ministry summoned Lu Shaye for a formal reprimand regarding his diplomatic behavior, and Chinese diplomats under his leadership accused French lawmakers of improper conduct. The French foreign ministry officially reprimanded the Chinese embassy for its diplomatic conduct during this period.\n\n**Academic and Cultural Connections**\n\nFrance serves as an important location for academic exchange and Chinese diaspora activities.
