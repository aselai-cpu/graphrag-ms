In 2013, Biden demonstrated his commitment to press freedom by warning China about pressuring journalists, signaling his willingness to confront Beijing on human rights issues.\n\nAs U.S. President, Biden's China policy has been characterized by both firmness and complexity. He has made repeated public statements pledging to defend Taiwan against potential Chinese attack, creating notable tension in U.S.-China relations. These declarations have been significant enough that his subordinates felt compelled to clarify that official U.S. policy toward Taiwan had not changed, highlighting a apparent disconnect between Biden's rhetoric and traditional diplomatic ambiguity on the Taiwan issue. Additionally, according to reporting, Biden's administration froze out China's Ambassador, indicating a cooling of diplomatic relations and a more confrontational stance toward Beijing.\n\nRegarding domestic politics, Biden's presidency has been marked by controversy stemming from the 2020 election, during which Donald Trump attempted to overturn Biden's electoral victory. This represented a significant challenge to American democratic institutions and the peaceful transfer of power.\n\nIn terms of personal characteristics, Biden's age has been a topic of public discussion, with references noting that he would be approximately eighty-two years old at the end of his first presidential term, making him one of the oldest individuals to serve as U.S. President.\n\nThroughout his career, Biden has demonstrated a willingness to engage directly with China on sensitive issues while maintaining a firm stance on American interests and values.
