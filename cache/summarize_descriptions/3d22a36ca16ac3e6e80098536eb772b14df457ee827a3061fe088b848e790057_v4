His connection to China dates back even further, as he first visited the country in the early 1980s, a period when China was just beginning to open up economically following the reforms initiated by Deng Xiaoping.\n\nWuttke's decades-long presence in China has made him a valuable source of insight into the evolution of China's economy, business practices, and foreign investment climate. His unique perspective spans multiple eras of China's development, from the early reform period through its rapid economic growth and emergence as a global economic power.\n\nIn August 2022, Jörg Wuttke was interviewed by an author, during which he presumably shared his expertise and observations about China's business environment and the experiences of European companies operating in the country.
