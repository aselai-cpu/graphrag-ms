Born in 1913 in Shaanxi province, Xi Zhongxun demonstrated early revolutionary commitment by joining the Communist Youth League at age 12 in 1926 and becoming a full party member at age 14. He served as a guerrilla fighter and distinguished himself through military service against both the Nationalist Party and the Japanese army.\n\nThroughout his career, Xi Zhongxun held numerous high-ranking positions, including propaganda minister, secretary general at the State Council, and vice premier in 1959. He worked closely with Gao Gang through the mid-1940s and developed deep roots in Shaanxi province. He had seven children from two marriages, and was known as a strict, frugal parent who enforced austerity and believed firmly that the party's interests come first.\n\nXi Zhongxun's political career was marked by dramatic upheavals. In fall 1962, he was purged for allegedly leading an anti-party clique and sent to work at a tractor factory in Luoyang, where he wouldn't see his family for seven years. During the Cultural Revolution, he became a pariah and suffered severe persecution, enduring abuse in struggle sessions and detention. He languished in the political wilderness for a decade and a half before his rehabilitation.\n\nFollowing his rehabilitation in early 1978, Xi Zhongxun was given a top post in Guangdong province, serving as provincial party chief from 1978 to 1980. In this role, he became a pioneer in Deng Xiaoping's reform and opening up program, playing a crucial role in establishing special economic zones and dealing with Hong Kong affairs. He was recognized as an economic reformer who advocated for a softer approach in ethnic policy during the 1950s-1980s, urging peaceful means to pacify unrest in Kashgar and being involved in religious policy matters.\n\nAs a party elder, Xi Zhongxun used his influence to support his son's career, lobbying on Xi Jinping's behalf with officials like Hebei party chief Gao Yang and helping arrange his transfer to Fujian through his old friend Xiang Nan. Later in life, he served as a senior legislative official and privately opposed the use of force during the 1989 protests. After retirement, he spent his final years in Shenzhen before passing away in a Beijing hospital in 2002 at age eighty-eight.\n\nXi Zhongxun's legacy was commemorated through multiple biographies, including a comprehensive two-volume work, and exhibitions at the Shekou Museum.
