Launched by Mao Zedong in summer 1966 to reclaim authority within the Communist Party, this fanatical movement purported to defend China against capitalist restoration but instead tore society apart and wreaked widespread havoc.\n\n## Political Impact and Violence\n\nThe Cultural Revolution resulted in violent purges, millions of deaths, and near civil war conditions across China. It involved the Red Guards engaging in political indoctrination and violent activities, with the Gang of Four serving as fervent enforcers of the movement's bloody excesses. Senior officials including Liu Shaoqi were purged, and the foreign ministry was particularly ravaged, with diplomats forced to abandon sophistication for revolutionary ardor to avoid persecution. The movement wiped out economic gains made in the early 1960s and shattered China's economy. Supervisory bodies were dissolved during this period of political chaos and persecution.\n\n## Regional Effects\n\nThe Cultural Revolution included a deadly anti-Mongol purge in Inner Mongolia. The movement also occurred in Hong Kong, as documented by William Heaton in 1970 in relation to Maoist revolutionary strategy. By December 1970, approximately four years into the revolution, Mao Zedong gave his notable interview with Edgar Snow.\n\n## Impact on Xi Jinping and His Family\n\nThe Cultural Revolution left a particularly complex mark on Xi Jinping, who would later become China's leader. During this period, Xi Jinping and his family were persecuted, with his father Xi Zhongxun being purged. Xi himself was detained, rusticated to Liangjiahe village in Yan'an, and forced to work as a rural laborer while his education was disrupted. He and Wang Qishan were rusticated to the same province during this tumultuous period. Despite the hardship and suffering, official hagiographic accounts later repackaged Xi's Cultural Revolution experience as a tale of redemption and triumph, portraying him as an \"Ambitious Survivor\" of the era.\n\n## Broader Social Impact\n\nThe movement affected millions of Chinese citizens. Pei Yiran was forced to work as a construction laborer and schoolteacher in the countryside. Youth of this era had severely limited access to books and education. Chen joined the Communist Party as a twenty-year-old during the revolution's dying days. The period evoked comparisons to China's later mass indoctrination camps according to contemporary reporting.\n\n## Historical Interpretation and Legacy\n\nThe 1981 party resolution drew a line under this period of Mao's megalomania and arbitrary rule, describing it as erupting at Mao's instigation and inflicting grave disaster. However, a 2021 Short History reframed the movement as happening due to broader social and historical factors rather than solely Mao's instigation. After the Cultural Revolution ended, Deng Xiaoping sought to revitalize the party with younger and better-educated cadres.\n\nThe Cultural Revolution remains a sensitive historical subject in China. Xi Jinping himself cited it as an example where \"democratic passions mixed with superstition and stupidity wreaked havoc.\" Academics could study this period only as long as they didn't question the party's legitimacy, and Chinese authorities have requested removal of articles covering this topic. Researchers like Sun Peidong at Fudan University have studied the period, including its impact on fashion and politics, sparked by conflicting recollections from those who lived through it.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"citations": null, "thinking_blocks": null}}}], "created": 1769998142, "model": "claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 801, "prompt_tokens": 1392, "total_tokens": 2193, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": null, "audio_tokens": null, "reasoning_tokens": null, "rejected_prediction_tokens": null, "text_tokens": 801}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null, "cache_creation_tokens": 0, "cache_creation_token_details": {"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens": 0, "ephemeral_1h_input_tokens": 0}}, "cache_creation_input_tokens": 0, "cache_read_input_tokens": 0}, "formatted_response": null, "content": "# Cultural Revolution: Comprehensive Summary\n\nThe Cultural Revolution, also known as the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, was a major sociopolitical movement and political campaign in China that lasted from 1966 to 1976.
