This elite committee serves as the party's most senior governing body, where members meet to discuss important matters and make critical decisions affecting China's governance.\n\n## Structure and Membership\n\nThe committee's size has varied over time. It was previously a nine-man body but was later reduced to seven members under Xi Jinping's leadership. Members of the Politburo Standing Committee are eligible to be selected as general secretary of the CCP, making it the primary pool from which China's paramount leader emerges.\n\n## Historical Developments\n\nThe committee has been central to several significant political events and transitions. In 1992, Hu Jintao was elevated to the Politburo Standing Committee, marking an important step in his political ascent. However, the body has also witnessed forced retirements and political purges. In 2002, both Qiao Shi and Li Ruihuan were pushed out or forced into retirement from the committee, demonstrating the competitive and sometimes contentious nature of elite Chinese politics.\n\nAt the 2007 party congress, both Xi Jinping and Li (likely Li Keqiang) were expected to win seats on the committee. Xi Jinping subsequently became a member and eventually emerged as the first among the leadership. By the nineteenth party congress, Xi notably did not promote anyone young enough to be considered his successor to the committee, breaking with previous succession planning traditions. In 2017, Wang Huning joined the Politburo Standing Committee, and Xi declined to elevate a potential successor, further consolidating his position.\n\n## Functions and Significance\n\nThe Politburo Standing Committee serves as the venue where potential successors would traditionally gain experience necessary to \"learn how to helm the ship of state.\" The body convened to discuss and vote on sensitive cases, such as the Wang Lijun incident and Ming Chai's arrest, with Xi personally informing the committee about the latter.\n\nThe committee represents a level of seniority once considered untouchable in Chinese politics, though this perception has evolved. After Huang Ju's death, his seat on the committee was left vacant. Additionally, the role of zhengfawei (political and legal affairs) secretary was downgraded from this highest decision-making body, reflecting shifts in the committee's composition and the relative power of different portfolios within the Chinese political system.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"citations": null, "thinking_blocks": null}}}], "created": 1769998168, "model": "claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 535, "prompt_tokens": 621, "total_tokens": 1156, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": null, "audio_tokens": null, "reasoning_tokens": null, "rejected_prediction_tokens": null, "text_tokens": 535}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null, "cache_creation_tokens": 0, "cache_creation_token_details": {"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens": 0, "ephemeral_1h_input_tokens": 0}}, "cache_creation_input_tokens": 0, "cache_read_input_tokens": 0}, "formatted_response": null, "content": "# Politburo Standing Committee\n\nThe Politburo Standing Committee is the highest decision-making body and top leadership body of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP).
