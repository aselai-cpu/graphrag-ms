In 2012, Gan Li published important research that revealed striking disparities in wealth distribution within Chinese society.

The Gini coefficient is a statistical measure ranging from 0 to 1, where 0 represents perfect equality and 1 represents maximum inequality. A coefficient of 0.61 suggests a high level of income disparity, placing China among countries with significant economic inequality concerns.
