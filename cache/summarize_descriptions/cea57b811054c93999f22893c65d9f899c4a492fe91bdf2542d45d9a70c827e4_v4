He served as Vice Minister of China's Ministry of Public Security, a senior position within China's domestic security apparatus, and simultaneously held the prestigious international role of President of Interpol, the global police organization.\n\nIn September 2018, Meng Hongwei disappeared during a work trip to Beijing, an event that drew international attention given his high-profile position at Interpol. His sudden disappearance sparked concern and confusion within the international law enforcement community, as he vanished without explanation while traveling from France, where Interpol is headquartered, to China.\n\nFollowing his disappearance, it was revealed that Meng Hongwei had been placed under investigation by China's National Supervisory Commission for violating the law. The investigation focused on allegations of corruption and abuse of power. As the probe progressed, Meng Hongwei faced serious charges related to bribery and other corrupt practices.\n\nThe consequences for Meng Hongwei were severe and multifaceted. He was expelled from the Communist Party of China, a significant political punishment that stripped him of his party membership and standing. Beyond the political ramifications, he faced criminal prosecution and was ultimately convicted on bribery charges. The court sentenced him to 13.5 years in prison for his crimes, marking a dramatic conclusion to what had been a distinguished career in Chinese security and international law enforcement.\n\nMeng Hongwei's case represents a notable example of China's anti-corruption campaign, which has targeted numerous high-ranking officials across various government sectors.
