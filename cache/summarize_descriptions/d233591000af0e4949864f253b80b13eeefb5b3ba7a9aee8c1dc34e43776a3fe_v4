He is notably recognized as the author of a significant monograph on deradicalization principles and strategies, which was published in Yining, a city in Xinjiang.\n\nIn his published work, Zhu Zhijie presents a comprehensive framework for deradicalization efforts in the region. His monograph outlines several key methodological approaches that he recommends for implementation. These strategies include ideological education programs designed to reshape beliefs and attitudes, the promotion of Chinese cultural infiltration as a means of assimilating targeted populations into mainstream Chinese cultural norms, and the use of compulsory correctional methods to enforce compliance and behavioral change.\n\nGiven his institutional affiliation with Xinjiang's prison administration bureau and his expertise in deradicalization strategies, Zhu Zhijie appears to be a significant figure in the development and articulation of policies related to correctional practices and ideological transformation programs in the Xinjiang region. His work provides insight into the theoretical and practical frameworks that inform official approaches to what Chinese authorities characterize as counter-extremism and deradicalization efforts.\n\nThe publication of his book in Yining, a major city in Xinjiang's Ili Kazakh Autonomous Prefecture, suggests that his work is intended to have practical application within the region and may serve as a guiding document for officials and institutions involved in implementing such programs.
