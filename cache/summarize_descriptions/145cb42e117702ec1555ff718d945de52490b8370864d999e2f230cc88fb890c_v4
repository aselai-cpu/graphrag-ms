As a distinguished military leader, he has become a prominent Taiwan defense expert and strategic thinker in the years following his active service.\n\nDuring and after his tenure as Taiwan's highest-ranking military officer, Lee Hsi-min has been a leading champion of asymmetric warfare strategy. This approach is specifically designed to counter the People's Liberation Army's (PLA) superior numbers and firepower, recognizing that Taiwan cannot match China's military capabilities through conventional means alone. His advocacy for asymmetric defense represents a pragmatic and innovative approach to Taiwan's security challenges.\n\nAs a defense expert, Lee Hsi-min has been actively engaged in public discourse about Taiwan's military preparedness and strategic positioning. He was interviewed about military issues in March 2022, during which he provided insights on Taiwan's defense strategy and shared his perspectives on critical security matters. His expertise has made him a valuable voice in discussions about Taiwan's fate and Beijing's intentions regarding unification with the island.\n\nLee Hsi-min has also contributed to academic and strategic literature on Taiwan's defense. He co-authored an article on Taiwan's Overall Defense Concept, a comprehensive framework that outlines how Taiwan should organize its defense capabilities to deter or defeat potential Chinese aggression.
