The war broke out in 1950 and had significant implications for international relations and the geopolitical landscape of East Asia during the early Cold War period.\n\nThe conflict involved multiple parties and had far-reaching consequences for the region. When the war erupted in 1950, it prompted the United States to send the Seventh Fleet to the Taiwan Strait as a defensive measure. This American military response had a direct impact on Chinese strategic planning, as Beijing made the decision to send troops to aid North Korea instead of proceeding with plans to invade Taiwan, effectively altering the course of cross-strait relations for decades to come.\n\nChina referred to this conflict as the \"War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea,\" reflecting its perspective on the nature of its involvement. The war included several significant military engagements, most notably the Battle of Chosin Reservoir, after which the conflict settled into a bloody stalemate. This grueling battle became one of the defining moments of the war, symbolizing the fierce resistance and harsh conditions faced by all parties involved.\n\nThe Korean War had profound personal consequences for Chinese leadership. Mao Anying, son of Mao Zedong, was killed during the conflict in a United Nations air strike. His death became a significant moment in Chinese history, with the seventieth anniversary of his death commemorated in November 2020, demonstrating the lasting impact of this loss on Chinese collective memory.\n\nIn the early years of the People's Republic of China, negotiations for an armistice to end the Korean War were underway, reflecting the desire of various parties to conclude the costly conflict. Following the war's conclusion, diplomatic efforts continued at the international level. Zhou Enlai and his team participated in talks held in Geneva, where they negotiated against representatives from the United States, Britain, and France regarding post-war arrangements and related matters stemming from the Korean conflict.\n\nThe Korean War ultimately ended in 1953 with an armistice agreement, though technically no peace treaty was ever signed, leaving the Korean Peninsula divided along the 38th parallel.
