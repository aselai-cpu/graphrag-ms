The Tiananmen Square protests of 1989 were student-led demonstrations calling for democracy, free speech, and government accountability, which ended in a violent military suppression that resulted in numerous casualties. Xi Jinping's pursuit of dissenters has been characterized as similarly severe, with observers drawing parallels between his administration's handling of political opposition and the harsh response to the 1989 demonstrations. This comparison highlights concerns about political freedoms, human rights, and the treatment of those who challenge the Chinese government under Xi's leadership.\n\nThese connections between Xi Jinping and Tiananmen Square illustrate the complex relationship between China's current leadership and its political history. On one hand, there were predictions that Xi might make symbolic breaks with the past, such as removing Mao's body from the square.
