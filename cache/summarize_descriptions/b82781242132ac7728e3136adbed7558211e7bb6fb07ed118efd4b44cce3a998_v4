His working conditions are notably poor and dismal—he labors in what is described as a \"dismal little cell\" within the counting-house, equipped with an inadequately small fire that provides insufficient warmth during cold weather. To cope with these harsh conditions, the Clerk wears a white comforter (a type of scarf) in an attempt to keep himself warm while he works.\n\nDespite these challenging circumstances, the Clerk earns a modest wage of fifteen shillings per week from Scrooge. He has a wife and family to support on this meager income, which adds to the difficulty of his situation. The cold working conditions he endures daily stand in stark contrast to what would be considered reasonable or comfortable employment standards.\n\nIn terms of character and disposition, the Clerk demonstrates a markedly different temperament from his employer, Scrooge. He is described as being more warm-hearted than Scrooge, suggesting a kind and generous nature that persists despite his difficult circumstances. This warmth of character is further evidenced by his attitude toward Christmas—unlike Scrooge, the Clerk embraces and celebrates the Christmas season, showing an appreciation for the holiday spirit and its values of generosity, family, and goodwill.\n\nThe contrast between the Clerk and Scrooge is significant: while Scrooge maintains a cold, miserly demeanor and provides inadequate working conditions with minimal compensation, the Clerk maintains his humanity and festive spirit. His ability to remain warm-hearted and celebrate Christmas despite working in cold, uncomfortable conditions for low wages speaks to his resilient and positive character.
