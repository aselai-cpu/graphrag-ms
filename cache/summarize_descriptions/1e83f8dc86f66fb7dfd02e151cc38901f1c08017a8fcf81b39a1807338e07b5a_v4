These democratic reforms represented a dramatic shift in governance and laid the groundwork for the pluralistic political system that Taiwan enjoys today.\n\nIn addition to his domestic reforms, Chiang Ching-kuo also took important steps in cross-strait relations with mainland China. He implemented policies designed to ease hostilities between Taiwan and the mainland, marking a departure from the previous era of strict separation and confrontation.
