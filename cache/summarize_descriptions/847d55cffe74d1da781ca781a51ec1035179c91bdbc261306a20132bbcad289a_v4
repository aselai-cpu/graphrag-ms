Under this framework, Beijing exercises comprehensive jurisdiction and rule over Hong Kong, maintaining ultimate control over the city's policies and political direction.\n\nIn recent years, Beijing has significantly tightened its control over Hong Kong through various measures. Most notably, in 2020, Beijing imposed a sweeping national security law on the territory, marking a major shift in the governance approach. This was accompanied by the implementation of political reforms designed to strengthen Beijing's authority. Additionally, Beijing has ruled out open elections in Hong Kong, effectively limiting the city's democratic development and maintaining firm control over Hong Kong's political trajectory.\n\nThe relationship between Beijing and Hong Kong has been marked by significant tension and conflict. In 2019, Hong Kong experienced major protests that challenged Beijing's authority and control over the city. In response to these demonstrations, Beijing implemented specific strategies aimed at handling the protests and further integrating Hong Kong into the broader Chinese political system. These measures were part of Beijing's broader effort to assert its comprehensive jurisdiction over the territory.\n\nAccording to some accounts, Beijing's governance of Hong Kong has been characterized by political repression. The combination of the national security law, political reforms, and restrictions on electoral processes has allegedly created an environment where political freedoms have been curtailed and dissent suppressed.\n\nThroughout these developments, Beijing has maintained its position as the ultimate authority over Hong Kong policy, exercising what it describes as comprehensive jurisdiction over all aspects of the territory's governance. This approach represents Beijing's interpretation and implementation of the \"one country, two systems\" framework, though critics argue that recent measures have significantly eroded the \"two systems\" aspect of this arrangement.\n\nThe evolution of Beijing's relationship with Hong Kong reflects a trajectory toward greater centralized control, particularly following the 2019 protests, with the 2020 national security law and subsequent political reforms serving as key instruments in consolidating Beijing's authority over the territory.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"citations": null, "thinking_blocks": null}}}], "created": 1769998656, "model": "claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 432, "prompt_tokens": 278, "total_tokens": 710, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": null, "audio_tokens": null, "reasoning_tokens": null, "rejected_prediction_tokens": null, "text_tokens": 432}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null, "cache_creation_tokens": 0, "cache_creation_token_details": {"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens": 0, "ephemeral_1h_input_tokens": 0}}, "cache_creation_input_tokens": 0, "cache_read_input_tokens": 0}, "formatted_response": null, "content": "# Comprehensive Summary: Beijing and Hong Kong\n\nBeijing maintains a complex governance relationship with Hong Kong based on the \"one country, two systems\" concept, which it has applied to the territory.
