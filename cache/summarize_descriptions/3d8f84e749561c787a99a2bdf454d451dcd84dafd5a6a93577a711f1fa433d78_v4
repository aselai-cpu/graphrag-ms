The deterioration in bilateral relations centered on two key actions taken by Lithuania: its decision to strengthen ties with Taiwan and its withdrawal from China's regional cooperation framework.\n\nLithuania made the notable decision to pull out of the China-Central and Eastern European Countries (China-CEEC) cooperation framework, also known as the 17+1 bloc (later 16+1 following Lithuania's departure). This initiative, established by China, was designed to enhance Beijing's economic and political influence across Central and Eastern European nations through investment and trade partnerships. Lithuania's withdrawal signaled a significant shift in its approach to relations with China and represented a break from the regional cooperation mechanism that China had cultivated.\n\nSimultaneously, Lithuania took steps to boost its relationship with Taiwan, a move that directly contradicted China's \"One China\" policy, which considers Taiwan an integral part of Chinese territory. This enhancement of Lithuania-Taiwan ties was viewed by Beijing as a serious provocation and a challenge to its core interests regarding territorial integrity and sovereignty.\n\nIn response to these actions, China applied substantial economic pressure on Lithuania. This pressure campaign was designed to punish Lithuania for its foreign policy choices and potentially serve as a warning to other nations considering similar moves. The economic coercion demonstrated China's willingness to use its economic leverage as a tool of diplomatic pressure against smaller nations that take positions contrary to Beijing's interests.\n\nThe situation highlighted the complex geopolitical dynamics in Europe, where smaller nations must navigate relationships between major powers while maintaining their sovereignty and values. Lithuania's stance represented a principled foreign policy approach, prioritizing democratic values and support for Taiwan despite the economic costs imposed by China. The case became emblematic of broader tensions between China and Western nations over issues of economic coercion, democratic values, and the status of Taiwan.\n\nThis episode in Lithuania-China relations also drew attention from the European Union and other international partners, raising questions about how democratic nations should respond to economic pressure tactics and how to support smaller countries facing coercion from larger powers. Lithuania's experience served as a test case for international solidarity in the face of economic statecraft employed by major powers.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"citations": null, "thinking_blocks": null}}}], "created": 1769998754, "model": "claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 484, "prompt_tokens": 206, "total_tokens": 690, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": null, "audio_tokens": null, "reasoning_tokens": null, "rejected_prediction_tokens": null, "text_tokens": 484}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null, "cache_creation_tokens": 0, "cache_creation_token_details": {"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens": 0, "ephemeral_1h_input_tokens": 0}}, "cache_creation_input_tokens": 0, "cache_read_input_tokens": 0}, "formatted_response": null, "content": "# Comprehensive Summary: Lithuania and China Relations\n\nLithuania, a Baltic nation and member of the European Union, experienced significant diplomatic and economic tensions with China following a series of foreign policy decisions that challenged Beijing's interests.
