When Deng Xiaoping pursued reforms, he explicitly refused to copy Western models of democracy and separation of powers, maintaining China's distinct political system. The relationship deteriorated significantly following the Tiananmen Square massacre, when the West recoiled at reports of the violence and Western leaders issued strong condemnations of China's actions.\n\nIn contemporary geopolitics, the West has become a focal point of growing Chinese distrust, particularly as anti-China sentiment has surged within Western policy circles. This sentiment intensified notably after the coronavirus emerged, creating additional friction between China and Western nations. President Xi Jinping has portrayed the West as belligerent, positioning China as ready to confront Western challenges. Despite this confrontational rhetoric, Xi simultaneously instructs Chinese diplomats to ensure stable ties with the West while vigorously fighting for Beijing's interests, reflecting a dual approach of engagement and resistance.\n\nThe relationship is characterized by multifaceted competition and tension. China is actively challenging the West across both economic and military fronts, representing a comprehensive strategic rivalry. Geopolitical tensions have manifested in specific areas, including disputes over Xinjiang, where Western countries have criticized China's policies and actions in the region.\n\nThe West's analytical capabilities regarding geopolitical shifts have also been questioned within Chinese discourse, with references to the West's failure to foresee the Soviet collapse being used to suggest limitations in Western strategic foresight.\n\nOverall, the West represents a region that embodies political systems and values fundamentally different from China's authoritarian model. It serves as both an adversary and a necessary partner in China's foreign policy calculus.
