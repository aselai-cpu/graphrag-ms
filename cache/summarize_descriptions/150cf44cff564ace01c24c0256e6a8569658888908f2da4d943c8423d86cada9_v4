However, the campaign became one of the most catastrophic policy failures in modern history.\n\nInstead of achieving its intended goals of industrialization and modernization, the Great Leap Forward devastated China's agricultural sector and resulted in widespread famine. The policies implemented during this period caused mass starvation that killed tens of millions of people, making it one of history's deadliest famines. The death toll from this disaster is estimated to be in the tens of millions, representing an unprecedented humanitarian catastrophe.\n\nThe failure of the Great Leap Forward had significant political ramifications for Mao Zedong himself.
