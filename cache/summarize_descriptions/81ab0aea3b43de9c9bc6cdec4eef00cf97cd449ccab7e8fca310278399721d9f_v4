According to reporting by the Wall Street Journal, this scrutiny of Xi Jinping's cousin by Australian authorities highlights concerns that extend beyond traditional diplomatic channels and into matters involving the Chinese leader's extended family members.\n\nThe examination of Xi Jinping's cousin by Australian authorities suggests that Australia's concerns regarding China encompass not only state-to-state relations but also activities of individuals connected to Chinese leadership.
