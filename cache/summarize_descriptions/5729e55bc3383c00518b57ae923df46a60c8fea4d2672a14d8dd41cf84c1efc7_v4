This designation refers to mainland China under Communist control and serves as the formal reference for the country in international contexts.\n\nDuring its early years under Mao's leadership, the People's Republic was largely off-limits to most Westerners. The nation endured significant hardship during the early 1960s when it was ravaged by the Great Leap Forward, one of the most catastrophic policy failures in modern history.\n\nOver the subsequent decades, the People's Republic transformed dramatically from its tumultuous beginnings. The country rose to middle-income nation status, with GDP per capita doubling between 2002 and 2012, demonstrating remarkable economic growth and development. Today, the People's Republic of China stands as the world's second-largest economy and a superpower-in-waiting, wielding significant influence on the global stage.\n\nThe political structure of the People's Republic has been characterized by relatively stable but tightly controlled leadership transitions. Notably, the country has conducted only two handovers of power that were not triggered by death or political crisis throughout its history. When Xi Jinping took power, the People's Republic was sixty-three years old, and his ascension marked just the second time that China completed a leadership transition not precipitated by the leader's death or a political crisis. Despite this relative stability, concerns persist that a succession crisis could potentially destabilize or even bring down the nation.\n\nIn recent years, the People's Republic has faced increasing international scrutiny and strategic competition. Under the Biden administration, the United States charted a broad strategy to face down the People's Republic across economic, military, and diplomatic fronts, reflecting the complex and often contentious relationship between the two powers.\n\nThe domestic political climate has also raised concerns among international observers. Foreign academics have expressed worry about potential detention when visiting the People's Republic, highlighting issues related to academic freedom and civil liberties within the country.\n\nThe People's Republic of China has been referenced in discussions about potential Soviet-style dissolution, though it has thus far maintained its territorial and political integrity.
