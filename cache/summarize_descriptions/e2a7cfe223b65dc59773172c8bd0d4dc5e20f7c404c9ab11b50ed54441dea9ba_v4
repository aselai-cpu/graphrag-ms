This incident highlights tensions between the international health body and Chinese authorities regarding adherence to global health protocols and guidelines during that particular health crisis.\n\nDuring the Covid-19 pandemic, the World Health Organization became embroiled in controversy regarding Taiwan's participation in its activities. The organization blocked Taiwanese officials from attending its annual assembly and technical meetings throughout the pandemic, a decision that raised questions about political influence on international health cooperation during a critical global health emergency.\n\nThe World Health Organization's leadership, specifically its director general, became the subject of diplomatic controversy when false Chinese diplomatic accusations alleged that the director general was the target of racist slurs. This incident reflects the complex political dynamics surrounding the organization and its relationship with member states.\n\nIn a more positive interaction with Chinese leadership, the World Health Organization praised Xi Jinping as a role model for quitting smoking in August 2016.
