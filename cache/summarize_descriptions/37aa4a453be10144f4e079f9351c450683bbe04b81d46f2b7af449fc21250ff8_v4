His leadership philosophy emphasized gradualism, bottom-up economic innovation, and the famous \"hide and bide\" approach to international relations, which counseled China to maintain a low profile while building strength.\n\nXi Jinping has publicly honored Deng's legacy on multiple occasions, paying homage during his first trip outside Beijing as leader by laying floral baskets at Deng's statue and retracing his famous 1992 southern tour to Guangdong to solicit investments. The official narrative portrays Xi as continuing Deng's work, with Deng having enriched the nation and Xi now strengthening it.\n\nHowever, Xi Jinping's actual governance represents a significant departure from Deng's approach. Xi has cast aside Deng's gradualist methods in favor of decisive, centralized leadership, declaring his intention to restore China to its rightful place on the world stage. He discarded the \"hide and bide\" philosophy for a more assertive international posture and shifted from Deng's bottom-up economic innovation model toward top-down state control. Most dramatically, Xi exceeded the ten-year term norm established by Deng and upended retirement conventions, effectively obliterating what many considered the most important political reforms of the post-Mao era.\n\nThe party has elevated Xi's stature at the expense of Deng's historical authority, with Xi being accused of resurrecting the one-man rule that Deng specifically tried to prevent. This tension became evident when Deng's famous quotations, which contradicted Xi's domineering leadership style, were removed from the 2021 Short History.
