The platform is officially blocked within China, yet it serves as a critical space for multiple, often contradictory purposes involving Chinese citizens, dissidents, and government officials.\n\n**Use by Chinese Dissidents and Critics**\n\nDespite being blocked in China, Twitter has become an important platform for Chinese dissidents and ordinary citizens to criticize the Communist Party and the Chinese government. Users like Zhou Shaoqing and others have utilized Twitter to post critical content about Chinese authorities. However, this activity comes with severe consequences—Chinese users who post on Twitter face significant risks, including detention and threats from authorities. Multiple Chinese citizens have been imprisoned for their posts on the platform, demonstrating the government's determination to suppress dissent even on foreign platforms.\n\n**Government and Diplomatic Presence**\n\nIn a striking contradiction to the platform's blocked status within China, Chinese diplomats and embassies have opened official accounts on Twitter to engage with foreign audiences. Notably, diplomat Zhao Lijian has used Twitter to spread conspiracy theories and engage in what has been termed \"wolf warrior diplomacy\"—an aggressive, confrontational approach to international relations. This dual approach highlights how the Chinese government blocks its own citizens from accessing Twitter while simultaneously using it as a tool for international propaganda and influence operations.\n\n**Specific Cases and Incidents**\n\nSeveral specific incidents illustrate Twitter's role in Chinese discourse. Chenchen Zhang posted comments about poverty alleviation on the platform in December 2018. Lu, a user who was apparently detained, was encouraged by Li Tingyu to open a Twitter account to disseminate his findings; after his release, Lu opened a new account, which subsequently led to police censure. The Great Translation Movement has used Twitter to publish translated ultranationalistic commentary, exposing extreme nationalist rhetoric to international audiences. Additionally, FactWire News Agency posted its closure announcement on Twitter on June 10, 2022.\n\n**Significance**\n\nTwitter represents a battleground for information control and free expression regarding China. While the Chinese government maintains strict censorship by blocking the platform domestically, it cannot prevent determined citizens from accessing it through technological workarounds. Simultaneously, the government exploits Twitter's global reach for its own diplomatic messaging, creating a situation where the platform is simultaneously forbidden and officially utilized—a contradiction that exemplifies the complexities of information control in the digital age.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"citations": null, "thinking_blocks": null}}}], "created": 1769998269, "model": "claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 526, "prompt_tokens": 449, "total_tokens": 975, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": null, "audio_tokens": null, "reasoning_tokens": null, "rejected_prediction_tokens": null, "text_tokens": 526}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null, "cache_creation_tokens": 0, "cache_creation_token_details": {"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens": 0, "ephemeral_1h_input_tokens": 0}}, "cache_creation_input_tokens": 0, "cache_read_input_tokens": 0}, "formatted_response": null, "content": "# TWITTER - Comprehensive Summary\n\nTwitter is a foreign social media platform that occupies a complex and paradoxical position in relation to China.
