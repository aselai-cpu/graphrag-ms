His work has addressed multiple dimensions of U.S.-China tensions, including military confrontations, territorial disputes, and economic security measures.\n\nAmong his notable reporting, Lubold co-authored an article examining former President Trump's executive actions to bar American investors from investing in Chinese firms that provide support to China's military apparatus. This reporting highlighted the intersection of economic policy and national security concerns in U.S.-China relations.\n\nLubold has also dedicated significant coverage to China's activities in the South China Sea, a region of ongoing territorial disputes and strategic importance. He co-authored multiple articles documenting Beijing's efforts to build up and militarize islands in the South China Sea, reporting on the infrastructure development and military installations that have raised concerns among regional neighbors and the United States. His coverage of this issue has provided readers with detailed insights into China's territorial ambitions and the changing strategic landscape in this contested maritime region.\n\nAdditionally, Lubold has reported on direct military encounters between U.S. and Chinese forces, including incidents where Chinese fighter aircraft conducted what were characterized as unsafe interceptions of U.S. spy planes. This reporting has shed light on the operational risks and potential for miscalculation in the increasingly crowded airspace and waters of the region.\n\nBeyond U.S.-China relations, Lubold has also covered America's security partnerships in the region, including reporting on the U.S.-Australia security alliance. This coverage demonstrates his broader understanding of the network of alliances and partnerships that underpin American strategy in the Indo-Pacific.\n\nThrough his comprehensive body of work, Gordon Lubold has established himself as a knowledgeable journalist covering critical national security issues, particularly those involving great power competition, military affairs, and the evolving strategic dynamics between the United States and China.
