He co-authored multiple articles covering critical developments in China's political landscape, including pieces on China's new leadership transitions and President Xi Jinping's activities in Zhejiang province. His reporting has also focused on economic policy, including an article about Beijing's endorsement of the market's role in the Chinese economy.\n\nA notable area of Davis's coverage has been China's anti-corruption campaign. He co-authored articles about Wang Qishan, who led China's sweeping anti-corruption efforts. Specifically, Davis reported on Wang Qishan's extensive investigations that probed thousands of officials, with one such article published in August 2014 documenting these anti-corruption efforts.\n\nAdditionally, Davis has written about China's evolving relationship with the United States and its positioning on the global stage. He co-authored an article examining China's message to America about the two nations being equals, reflecting the shifting dynamics in bilateral relations and China's growing confidence as a global power.\n\nThrough his work both as a journalist and author, Bob Davis has established himself as an authoritative voice on U.S.-China relations, Chinese domestic politics, and the broader implications of China's rise as a superpower.
