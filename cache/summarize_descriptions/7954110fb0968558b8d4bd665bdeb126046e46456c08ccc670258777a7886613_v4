The newspaper has published numerous investigative stories and articles covering critical aspects of Chinese politics, society, and governance.\n\nThe publication has conducted major investigative journalism on Chinese leadership, including articles about Chinese leaders' wealth, Xi Jinping's relatives shedding assets during his anti-graft campaign, and leaked internal party documents containing Xi's statements during his trip to Urumqi. The newspaper has also extensively covered Bo Xilai's rise and fall, and published Nicholas Kristof's op-ed in January 2013 predicting Xi Jinping would bring reform to China, as well as Kristof's articles about China's Olympics and other China-related topics.\n\nThe New York Times has reported extensively on human rights issues and government policies in China, including China's law-enforcement actions against speech offenses, the country's surveillance state, high-tech surveillance in Xinjiang, DNA equipment purchases for Xinjiang, and leaked files exposing China's mass detentions of Muslims. The newspaper has covered Chinese student protests and denunciations of limits on free speech in December 2019, China making it a crime to mock heroes, and the suspension of scholar Xu Zhangrun.\n\nThe publication has also reported on various contemporary issues including China's Zero Covid policy, pandemic policy U-turn, governance challenges, Tiananmen Square (including an article published on June 2, 2014), Taiwan-China relations, Airbnb shutting down in China, Twitter censorship, Chinese military affairs, and Disney's operations in China. Additionally, the newspaper published Chris Buckley's article about a historian's book on Mao and articles about a Wuhan writer.\n\nDue to its critical reporting, the New York Times has faced significant repercussions from Chinese authorities. Following investigative stories about Chinese leaders' wealth published around 2013, the newspaper's journalists faced visa threats. In the first half of 2020, multiple New York Times journalists were expelled from China. These pressures led to significant operational changes: the newspaper moved its Asia-Pacific news-editing hub from Hong Kong to Seoul, citing the security law and deteriorating conditions for media.
