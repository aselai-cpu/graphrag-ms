As one of China's largest tech companies, Alibaba has faced substantial regulatory challenges from Chinese authorities in recent years.\n\nMost notably, Alibaba was hit with a record-breaking $2.8 billion fine from China's antitrust agency for engaging in anticompetitive business practices. This unprecedented penalty represents one of the largest antitrust fines ever imposed by Chinese regulators and marks a significant moment in China's regulatory crackdown on its technology sector.\n\nThe regulatory actions against Alibaba reflect broader efforts by the Chinese government to exert greater control over major technology companies operating within its borders.
