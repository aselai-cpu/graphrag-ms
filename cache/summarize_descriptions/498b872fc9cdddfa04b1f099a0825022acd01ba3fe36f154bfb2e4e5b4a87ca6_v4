As a former soldier who served in the People's Liberation Army (PLA), Wang Fenghe worked specifically as an infantry radioman during his military service. This role would have placed him in a critical communications position within his unit, responsible for maintaining radio contact and transmitting important information during his time in the armed forces.\n\nFollowing his military service, Wang Fenghe transitioned to civilian life and now works in the construction industry. He currently resides in rural Inner Mongolia, an autonomous region in northern China known for its vast grasslands and sparse population compared to China's eastern coastal areas. His residence in rural Inner Mongolia suggests he may be part of the significant population of former military personnel who have settled in China's less urbanized regions.\n\nPolitically, Wang Fenghe is characterized as an ardent supporter of the Communist Party of China and specifically of Xi Jinping, who has served as the General Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party and President of the People's Republic of China since 2012-2013. This strong political allegiance is consistent with his background as a former PLA soldier, as military service in China typically involves significant political education and loyalty to the Party. His unwavering support for both the Party and its current leadership reflects the sentiments of many veterans who maintain their ideological commitment to the political system they served under during their military careers.\n\nWang Fenghe is referenced in source material with specific page citations (179-80), suggesting he may be featured as a case study, interview subject, or illustrative example in a larger work examining contemporary Chinese society, military veterans, political attitudes, or rural life in China.
