These historical resolutions served as important mechanisms for shaping party ideology and legitimizing leadership transitions.\n\nMao served as the earlier leader, establishing his political legacy and ideological framework known as Mao Zedong Thought. His leadership style was characterized by mass mobilization campaigns, which became a defining feature of governance during his era. However, Mao's later years were marked by what would subsequently be characterized as megalomania and significant errors in judgment and policy.\n\nDeng succeeded Mao as party leader and represented a pivotal shift in Chinese Communist Party governance and ideology. In 1981, Deng enacted a historical resolution that served multiple complex political purposes. This resolution was carefully crafted to navigate the delicate balance between repudiating Mao's excesses while maintaining the legitimacy of the party and its ideological foundations. Specifically, the 1981 resolution repudiated Mao's megalomania and acknowledged his serious errors, yet simultaneously preserved Mao Zedong Thought as a legitimate ideological framework and declared Mao to be a great Marxist despite his mistakes. This nuanced approach allowed Deng to establish his own authority and policy direction while avoiding a complete delegitimization of the party's history and Mao's contributions.\n\nUnder Deng's leadership, there was a fundamental change in the approach to campaign governance. Unlike Mao's reliance on mass mobilization as a primary tool of political and social control, Deng deliberately avoided such mass mobilization campaigns. This shift represented a more pragmatic and less ideologically driven approach to governance, marking a significant departure from Mao's methods and ushering in a new era of Chinese political leadership.\n\nThe relationship between these two leaders illustrates the complex dynamics of political succession and ideological continuity within the Chinese Communist Party. While Deng needed to differentiate his leadership from Mao's excesses and errors, he also required the legitimacy that came from maintaining continuity with the party's revolutionary heritage. The 1981 resolution exemplifies this careful balancing act, allowing for criticism of specific policies and behaviors while preserving the broader ideological framework and historical narrative that underpinned party authority.\n\nTogether, Mao and Deng's use of historical resolutions demonstrates how party leaders have utilized such instruments to shape collective memory, establish political legitimacy, and manage transitions of power while maintaining party unity and ideological coherence.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"citations": null, "thinking_blocks": null}}}], "created": 1769998606, "model": "claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 566, "prompt_tokens": 250, "total_tokens": 816, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": null, "audio_tokens": null, "reasoning_tokens": null, "rejected_prediction_tokens": null, "text_tokens": 566}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null, "cache_creation_tokens": 0, "cache_creation_token_details": {"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens": 0, "ephemeral_1h_input_tokens": 0}}, "cache_creation_input_tokens": 0, "cache_read_input_tokens": 0}, "formatted_response": null, "content": "# Comprehensive Summary: MAO and DENG\n\nMao and Deng were both significant party leaders in Chinese Communist Party history who each enacted resolutions on history during their respective tenures.
