These overlapping claims have been a source of ongoing tension and dispute between the two nations. The nine-dash line represents China's assertion of sovereignty over vast portions of the South China Sea, which conflicts with the maritime entitlements and territorial claims of several neighboring countries, including the Philippines.\n\nIn response to these territorial disputes, the Philippines took significant legal action by bringing the matter to international arbitration. The country filed a case against Chinese sovereignty claims with the Permanent Court of Arbitration, requesting formal arbitration regarding the South China Sea dispute with China. This legal challenge represented a major diplomatic and legal effort by the Philippines to resolve the territorial conflicts through international legal mechanisms rather than bilateral negotiations or military confrontation.\n\nThe Philippines' approach to the South China Sea issue has been notably different from some of its regional neighbors.
