Xi Jinping is himself a member of the Politburo Standing Committee and has chaired meetings of this elite group, demonstrating his central role in China's political leadership structure.\n\nThroughout his tenure, Xi Jinping has exercised considerable control over the composition and functioning of the Politburo Standing Committee. Notably, at the 2017 party congress, he declined to elevate a potential successor into the Politburo Standing Committee, a decision that broke with previous precedents of grooming clear successors for leadership transition. This move signaled a departure from established norms, as the Politburo Standing Committee had traditionally been used by Chinese leaders to prepare potential successors for high office.\n\nXi Jinping has also demonstrated his authority through structural reforms affecting the Politburo Standing Committee's composition. He downgraded the zhengfawei (Political and Legal Affairs Commission) secretary role from the Politburo Standing Committee level, representing a significant reorganization of power within the party's top echelon. This change reflected Xi's broader efforts to consolidate control over key party institutions.\n\nIn matters of sensitive political cases and investigations, Xi Jinping has maintained direct involvement with the Politburo Standing Committee. He personally informed the Politburo Standing Committee about Ming Chai's arrest, indicating his hands-on approach to significant political developments. Additionally, Xi participated in the Politburo Standing Committee's deliberations on the Wang Lijun case, where he argued for broader investigations. This case was particularly significant as it eventually led to wider anti-corruption efforts and political purges.\n\nThe relationship between Xi Jinping and the Politburo Standing Committee illustrates the concentration of power in contemporary Chinese politics. While the Politburo Standing Committee remains the formal apex of party authority, Xi Jinping's leadership style has been characterized by personal control over its deliberations, membership decisions, and structural configuration.
