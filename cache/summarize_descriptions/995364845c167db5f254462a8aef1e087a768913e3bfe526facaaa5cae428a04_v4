According to historical accounts, Mao's megalomania was a driving force behind instigating this decade-long campaign that would have profound and devastating effects on Chinese society.\n\nThe Cultural Revolution had far-reaching consequences across multiple sectors of Chinese society. The movement wiped out significant economic gains that had been achieved in previous years, setting back China's development considerably. The foreign ministry was among the many government institutions that were ravaged during this period, reflecting the widespread disruption to state functions and diplomatic relations.\n\nThe Cultural Revolution was ongoing during Mao Zedong's 1970 interview, demonstrating that he remained in his leadership position as chairman throughout much of this turbulent period. His role in leading and directing the movement from its inception in 1966 until its conclusion in 1976 is well-documented in historical records.\n\nInterestingly, the historical treatment of Mao's role in the Cultural Revolution has evolved over time, reflecting changing political sensitivities within the Communist Party of China. Earlier party histories explicitly stated that Mao instigated the Cultural Revolution and acknowledged his mistakes in launching this campaign. However, later official party histories, particularly the 2021 version, notably softened this language and omitted direct references to Mao's errors in initiating the movement. This revision demonstrates how the Communist Party's official narrative has been adjusted to present a more nuanced or favorable view of Mao's legacy, despite the well-established historical facts about his central role in orchestrating the Cultural Revolution.\n\nThe Cultural Revolution remains one of the most significant and controversial periods in modern Chinese history, and Mao Zedong's responsibility for launching and leading this movement is a critical aspect of understanding both his legacy and the trajectory of twentieth-century China.
