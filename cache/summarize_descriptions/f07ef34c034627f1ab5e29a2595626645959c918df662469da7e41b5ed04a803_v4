This strategic emphasis reflects the centrality of Taiwan to China's military planning and national objectives.\n\nThe military imbalance between the two forces is substantial, with PLA ground troops outnumbering the Taiwanese army by more than tenfold, creating a significant conventional military advantage that poses a credible invasion threat to Taiwan. This overwhelming numerical superiority underscores the asymmetric nature of the military relationship between the PLA and Taiwan's defense forces.\n\nHistorically, the PLA has demonstrated its willingness to conduct aggressive military operations in the Taiwan Strait region. During the 1995-1996 Taiwan Strait Crisis, the PLA practiced amphibious landings and fired missiles near Taiwan, marking a significant escalation in cross-strait tensions. These exercises served as both a demonstration of military capability and a political signal regarding Beijing's position on Taiwan.\n\nIn contemporary operations, the PLA is extensively involved in military affairs related to Taiwan through a sustained campaign of military pressure. The PLA regularly conducts military operations, sorties, and drills in the vicinity of Taiwan with strategic objectives that extend beyond simple military exercises. These operations are designed to systematically wear down Taiwan's defenses through attrition, forcing the Taiwanese military to repeatedly scramble aircraft and activate defense systems in response to PLA activities. Additionally, these persistent military activities serve a psychological warfare function, intended to demoralize the Taiwanese people and erode their confidence in their island's defensive capabilities and political autonomy.\n\nThis pattern of sustained military pressure represents a comprehensive strategy that combines conventional military superiority, regular operational activities, and psychological operations to advance the PLA's strategic objectives regarding Taiwan.
