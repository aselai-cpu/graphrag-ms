He is often referred to as \"the professor\" in diplomatic communications.\n\n## Academic Career\n\nYi Xiaoxiong worked as an academic at Marietta College in the United States for more than three decades before retiring in 2021. His long tenure at this American institution positioned him as a bridge between Chinese and Western perspectives.\n\n## Personal Background\n\nYi Xiaoxiong comes from a revolutionary family with a complex relationship to the Chinese Communist Party. He is the son of a former revolutionary who was persecuted by Red Guards during China's Cultural Revolution. This family history likely shaped his own views on Chinese politics and governance.\n\n## Relationship with Xi Jinping\n\nYi Xiaoxiong was a former friend of Xi Jinping and had personal insights into Xi's character and worldview. Through his conversations with American diplomatic sources, Yi provided valuable biographical details about Xi that helped U.S. officials understand the Chinese leader's background and motivations.\n\nAccording to Yi's accounts to American diplomats, Xi Jinping is repulsed by the commercialization of Chinese society and doesn't care about money. This characterization suggests that Xi's political philosophy is driven more by ideological concerns than by economic considerations, which has proven relevant to understanding Xi's governance approach.\n\n## Political Disillusionment\n\nDespite their friendship, Yi Xiaoxiong ultimately felt betrayed by Xi Jinping's embrace of the Chinese Communist Party. This sense of betrayal is particularly poignant given Yi's family history—his father's persecution by the party during the Cultural Revolution makes Xi's wholehearted commitment to the party apparatus especially difficult for Yi to accept. This personal disappointment reflects broader tensions between those who hoped for political reform in China and the reality of Xi's consolidation of party power.\n\n## Significance\n\nYi Xiaoxiong's role as a source for American diplomats highlights the importance of personal relationships and informal channels in international intelligence gathering. His willingness to share insights about Xi Jinping with U.S. officials provided valuable context for understanding one of the world's most powerful leaders, even as it marked the end of their personal friendship.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"citations": null, "thinking_blocks": null}}}], "created": 1769998190, "model": "claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 502, "prompt_tokens": 308, "total_tokens": 810, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": null, "audio_tokens": null, "reasoning_tokens": null, "rejected_prediction_tokens": null, "text_tokens": 502}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null, "cache_creation_tokens": 0, "cache_creation_token_details": {"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens": 0, "ephemeral_1h_input_tokens": 0}}, "cache_creation_input_tokens": 0, "cache_read_input_tokens": 0}, "formatted_response": null, "content": "# Yi Xiaoxiong: Comprehensive Summary\n\nYi Xiaoxiong is a Chinese academic and former friend of Xi Jinping who served as an important source of biographical information about the Chinese leader to American diplomatic officials.
