This second ousting was notably connected to his controversial public statements, particularly his criticism of China's industrial policy, which he characterized as a waste of money. Such frank assessments of government policy, while potentially reflecting his technocratic expertise and commitment to economic efficiency, were evidently deemed inappropriate or problematic by Chinese leadership.\n\nLou Jiwei's career trajectory illustrates the challenges faced by outspoken technocrats within China's political system, where candid criticism of government policies can result in professional consequences, even for high-ranking officials with significant expertise.
