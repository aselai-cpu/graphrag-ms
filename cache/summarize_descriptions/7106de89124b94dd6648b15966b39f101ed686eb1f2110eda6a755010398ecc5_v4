During this period spanning nearly three decades, Mao established himself as the defining figure of the Communist Party, fundamentally shaping its ideology, policies, and operational methods.\n\nAs the leader of the Communist Party, Mao Zedong exercised dictatorial control over China, ruling with what has been characterized as mercurial and charismatic leadership. He utilized the Communist Party as a primary tool of revolution, transforming it into an instrument for implementing his vision of socialist transformation in China. His leadership style was marked by personal charisma combined with authoritarian control, allowing him to direct the party's direction and maintain his grip on power throughout his rule.\n\nMao established several foundational principles that would define the Communist Party's approach to governance and power. Most notably, he articulated the principle that \"political power comes from the barrel of a gun,\" emphasizing the role of military force and armed struggle in achieving and maintaining political control. This philosophy became central to the Communist Party's ideology and its approach to consolidating power in China.\n\nUnder Mao's leadership, the Communist Party developed a systematic approach to controlling historical narratives. Mao led the party in establishing methods for shaping how history was recorded, interpreted, and presented to the Chinese people, ensuring that the party's version of events became the official narrative. This control over historical interpretation became a crucial tool for legitimizing the Communist Party's rule and Mao's own leadership.\n\nThroughout his tenure from 1949 to 1976, Mao Zedong was responsible for shaping the Communist Party's major policies and campaigns. His influence extended across all aspects of party operations, from ideological direction to practical implementation of revolutionary programs. The Communist Party under Mao's leadership launched numerous campaigns and initiatives that transformed Chinese society, economy, and culture, though the specific nature and outcomes of these campaigns varied considerably.\n\nMao's relationship with the Communist Party was symbiotic yet hierarchical—while he led and directed the party, he also used it as the primary vehicle for implementing his revolutionary agenda and maintaining control over China.
