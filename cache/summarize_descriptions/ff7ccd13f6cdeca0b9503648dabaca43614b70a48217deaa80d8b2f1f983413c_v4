He is five years older than Xi and has been described as Xi's right-hand man throughout various political endeavors.\n\n## Career and Political Roles\n\nWang Qishan's career demonstrates his versatility as a skilled political operator. In 2008, he served as China's vice premier, during which time he met with U.S. Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson and expressed skepticism about the American economic system. Earlier in his career, he worked at a central government office studying rural affairs, where he hosted Xi Jinping and other local officials for policy discussions—a relationship that would prove significant in later years.\n\nIn November 2012, Wang became Secretary of the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection (CCDI), China's top anti-corruption body. In this role, he earned the nickname \"fire brigade chief\" for his exceptional crisis management skills and became known as China's top graft buster, probing thousands of corruption cases. His anticorruption campaign, which he ran on behalf of Xi, was extensive and far-reaching, cementing his reputation as China's second most powerful official during his tenure.\n\nAfter serving five years as anticorruption czar, Wang stepped down from party leadership in late 2017. He subsequently became Vice President of China, a position from which he continued to influence policy, including advocating for more safeguards against systemic risks in China's financial system.\n\n## Personal Background and Characteristics\n\nWang Qishan is considered a princeling through his marriage to a party elder's daughter, connecting him to China's political elite. He is known for his honesty and his reputation as a skilled political operator who can navigate complex political situations effectively.\n\n## Recent Developments\n\nIn an ironic turn of events, starting in 2020, Wang's own political and personal circles became targets of anti-graft enforcers—the very apparatus he had once commanded. This development highlights the complex and sometimes unpredictable nature of Chinese elite politics.\n\nThroughout his career, Wang Qishan has been involved in critical policy discussions and trade disputes, consistently serving as a key figure in Xi Jinping's administration and maintaining his position as one of the most influential figures in contemporary Chinese politics.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"citations": null, "thinking_blocks": null}}}], "created": 1769998197, "model": "claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 524, "prompt_tokens": 527, "total_tokens": 1051, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": null, "audio_tokens": null, "reasoning_tokens": null, "rejected_prediction_tokens": null, "text_tokens": 524}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null, "cache_creation_tokens": 0, "cache_creation_token_details": {"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens": 0, "ephemeral_1h_input_tokens": 0}}, "cache_creation_input_tokens": 0, "cache_read_input_tokens": 0}, "formatted_response": null, "content": "# Wang Qishan: Comprehensive Summary\n\nWang Qishan is a prominent Chinese political figure who has served in multiple high-level positions and is widely recognized as one of Xi Jinping's oldest friends and most trusted allies.
