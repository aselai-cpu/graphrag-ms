She has written extensively about Taiwan's self-defense interests and the broader security challenges facing the territory. Her reporting in this area gained particular prominence when she co-authored Wall Street Journal articles covering then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's controversial visit to Taiwan and the subsequent Chinese military drills that followed this high-profile diplomatic event. These articles addressed one of the most significant moments of tension in cross-strait relations in recent years.\n\nBeyond her coverage of Taiwan, Wang has also reported extensively on Hong Kong, demonstrating her broad expertise across multiple Chinese territories. She co-authored articles for the Wall Street Journal about the Hong Kong protests, capturing the political upheaval and social movements that transformed the city. Her Hong Kong coverage has also extended to education-related topics, including reporting on teachers and education policies in the region, showing her ability to cover both hard news and social policy issues.\n\nWang's journalistic contributions extend beyond her bylined work. She has played an important collaborative role in the editorial process, helping to review drafts, correct misapprehensions, and sharpen arguments in various pieces. This indicates that she serves not only as a reporter but also as a valued editorial contributor who helps ensure accuracy and clarity in complex reporting about China and its surrounding regions.\n\nHer body of work reflects a deep understanding of China's military activities and their implications for regional security, particularly as they relate to Taiwan. Through her reporting, Wang has helped international audiences understand the evolving military dynamics in the Taiwan Strait and the broader Indo-Pacific region.\n\nOverall, Joyu Wang has established herself as a knowledgeable and reliable journalist covering some of the most sensitive and important stories in East Asia, including military tensions, political protests, and social policy issues across Taiwan and Hong Kong.
