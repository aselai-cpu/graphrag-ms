This controversy reflects fundamentally different interpretations of the same institutions: Western scholars and human rights organizations have characterized these facilities as detention centers for mass internment of Uyghurs and other Muslim minorities, while Chinese official narratives describe them as voluntary educational and vocational training programs designed to combat extremism and poverty. The intensity of the academic response to Millward's work suggests that the Chinese government views Western scholarship on these facilities as a significant threat to its narrative control.

The focus on historical distortion is particularly significant because it positions the debate not merely as a disagreement over contemporary policies but as a fundamental contest over historical truth and interpretation.
