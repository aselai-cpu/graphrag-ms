The community structure reveals a deliberate political strategy where an initial campaign encouraging open criticism was followed by severe repression.

This direct leadership role in such a large-scale persecution campaign highlights Mao's approach to governance, which prioritized political control and ideological purity over individual rights and open discourse.

This sequence of events suggests that the Hundred Flowers Campaign may have served as a trap to identify critics and dissenters, who were then targeted in the subsequent purge.
