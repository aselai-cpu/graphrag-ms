Torigian has written extensively about Xi Jinping's family lessons, including an article for Foreign Policy examining how the Tiananmen Square incident influenced Xi's perspectives. This focus on familial and historical influences on contemporary Chinese leadership provides valuable insights into understanding current Chinese politics and policy decisions. Torigian's work in this area has explored specific policy domains, such as Xinjiang governance, revealing how historical family experiences and lessons have shaped Xi Jinping's approach to governance.
