The bureau has employed correspondents who have dedicated substantial periods to covering the region, with documented cases of correspondents working in Beijing for five years or more [Data: Relationships (10)]. Charles Hutzler, who spent over two decades reporting from China, exemplifies this long-term commitment, having brought other journalists to Beijing and mentored them in covering Chinese affairs [Data: Entities (1256); Relationships (3871)].
