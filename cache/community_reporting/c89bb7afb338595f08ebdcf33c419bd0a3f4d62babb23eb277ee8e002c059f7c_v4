Legalism, an ancient Chinese philosophical school, emphasizes strict laws, centralized authority, and state power over individual rights, contrasting sharply with Confucianism's focus on moral virtue, social harmony, and ethical governance. By making this argument, Crane contributes to a more nuanced understanding of how historical Chinese philosophical traditions inform modern authoritarian governance.

This is not merely an academic distinction but has profound implications for understanding Chinese governance, policy-making, and the nature of state-society relations under Xi's leadership. Confucianism has often been invoked by Chinese leaders and Western observers as a cultural explanation for Chinese political practices, emphasizing harmony, hierarchy, and moral leadership. However, Crane's argument that Xi's China is fundamentally Legalist suggests a different interpretation focused on state power, legal control, and authoritarian governance mechanisms. Legalism historically advocated for a powerful centralized state, strict enforcement of laws, and the subordination of individual interests to state objectives. This framework may better explain contemporary Chinese practices such as extensive surveillance, strict social control, anti-corruption campaigns used to consolidate power, and the emphasis on party discipline and loyalty. The debate has implications for how international observers, policymakers, and scholars understand and engage with China. If Xi's governance is indeed more Legalist than Confucian, it suggests different motivations, constraints, and potential trajectories for Chinese domestic and foreign policy.
