His revolutionary credentials were established through guerrilla fighting and military service against both the Nationalist Party and Japanese invaders in Northwestern China, where he fought alongside other Communist leaders including Gao Gang and Liu Zhidan until Liu's death in 1936 [Data: Entities (100, 145); Relationships (308)]. Xi Zhongxun's career trajectory took him through numerous high-ranking positions, including propaganda minister, secretary general at the State Council, and vice premier in 1959 [Data: Entities (100); Relationships (253)]. His role as propaganda minister was particularly significant, placing him in a critical position for shaping the Party's ideological messaging [Data: Relationships (253)]. However, his political career was marked by dramatic upheavals. In fall 1962, he was purged for allegedly leading an anti-party clique and sent to work at a tractor factory in Luoyang, where he wouldn't see his family for seven years [Data: Entities (100)]. During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, launched by Mao Zedong in May 1966 as the most radical and destructive mass purge in Chinese history, Xi Zhongxun became a pariah and suffered severe persecution, enduring abuse in struggle sessions and detention [Data: Entities (100, 159)].\"}, {\"summary\": \"Family Tragedy During the Cultural Revolution\", \"explanation\": \"The Cultural Revolution inflicted devastating personal costs on the Xi family, exemplifying the broader tragedy that befell families of purged officials. Xi Zhongxun's eldest daughter Heping, Xi Jinping's half-sister, was persecuted to death during this period and is believed to have been hounded into suicide [Data: Entities (162); Relationships (353)]. When Xi Jinping received the letter informing him of Heping's death, he was moved to tears, demonstrating the profound emotional impact of this loss [Data: Entities (162)]. Qi Xin, Xi Jinping's mother and Xi Zhongxun's second wife, endured extremely difficult circumstances during the Cultural Revolution, being forced to participate in struggle sessions where she had to shout slogans against her own son [Data: Entities (118)]. In one of the most painful episodes, when Xi Jinping escaped from detention, Qi Xin made the agonizing decision to report him to the authorities herself, driven by fear that if she didn't comply, she would be detained and her other children would be left without parental care [Data: Entities (118)]. This incident illustrates the impossible choices families faced during this period, where political survival often required betraying loved ones.

His reformist instincts and commitment to hard work and frugality were celebrated during official commemorations of the 100th anniversary of his birth [Data: Entities (100); Relationships (4022)].
