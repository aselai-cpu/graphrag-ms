Wang is described as one of Xi's oldest friends and most trusted allies, serving as Xi's right-hand man throughout various political endeavors.

He earned the nickname 'fire brigade chief' for his exceptional ability to handle critical situations, and became known as China's top graft buster when he served as Secretary of the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection starting in November 2012.

Most significantly, the Global Financial Crisis dispelled Beijing's traditional deference to Washington, marking a fundamental shift in how Chinese leadership viewed the United States and its economic leadership.

While the United States and other Western economies grappled with banking collapses, housing market crashes, and severe recessions, China's economy continued to demonstrate growth and stability.
