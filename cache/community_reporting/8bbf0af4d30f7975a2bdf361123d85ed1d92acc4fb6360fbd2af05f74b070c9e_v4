The relationship between Ma Rong and Xi Jinping, while indirect through scholarly analysis rather than direct collaboration, carries significant weight given the combined degree of 578, indicating substantial connectivity within the broader network [Data: Relationships (5702)]. This high degree of connectivity suggests that Ma Rong's work on ethnic policy has resonated widely and connects to numerous other entities in the larger information landscape.

The fact that Ma Rong chose to write about these remarks suggests that Xi Jinping's 2018 statements represented a significant policy moment or shift in China's approach to ethnic affairs.

The Central Institute of Socialism's role as publisher is significant because it represents an institutional endorsement of Ma Rong's work and suggests that his analysis aligns with official ideological frameworks. The institute's involvement indicates that Ma Rong's interpretation of Xi Jinping's ethnic work guidance was considered appropriate for publication in a venue associated with socialist ideology and political education.
