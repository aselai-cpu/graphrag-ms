The community structure reveals a family deeply embedded in China's revolutionary history and contemporary political power, with members transitioning from public service to business success. Qi Xin's role as revolutionary, mother, and author provides insight into the family's experiences during critical periods of Chinese history, including the Cultural Revolution. The community also includes institutional entities such as China's paramilitary police, where Qi Qiaoqiao served, and the Remembering Xi Zhongxun Editorial Team, which compiled commemorative works about the family patriarch.

She was compelled to participate in struggle sessions where she had to shout slogans against her own son, Xi Jinping, illustrating the extreme psychological torture inflicted on families during this period [Data: Entities (118)]. In one of the most painful episodes, when Xi Jinping escaped from detention, Qi Xin made the heart-wrenching decision to report him to the authorities herself [Data: Entities (118)]. This decision was driven by desperate circumstances—she feared being detained if she didn't comply, which would have left her other children without any parental care [Data: Entities (118)]. This incident exemplifies the impossible choices that families faced during the Cultural Revolution, where political survival often required betraying one's own loved ones.
