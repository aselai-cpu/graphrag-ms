Project Gutenberg's primary mission centers on distributing literary works that have entered the public domain in the United States, meaning these works are no longer protected by copyright restrictions within U.S. territory [Data: Relationships (396)].

However, it is important to note that while Project Gutenberg operates under U.S. copyright law, the copyright status of works may differ in other countries, meaning a work in the public domain in the United States may still be protected by copyright in other jurisdictions [Data: Relationships (396)].
