The community also includes Alfred Wu, a politics professor who observed Xi during this period while working as a newspaper reporter, and Chen Kai, a crime boss whose activities highlighted corruption challenges during this era.

During this extended period, Xi held the position of municipal party boss (Municipal Party Secretary), giving him significant authority over the city's governance and development trajectory [Data: Entities (233)]. This twelve-year tenure was notably long for a municipal leadership position and provided Xi with extensive experience in urban administration and policy implementation. The duration of his service in Fuzhou allowed him to see projects through from conception to completion, developing a comprehensive understanding of governance challenges and solutions. Xi's time in Fuzhou was characterized by his advocacy and implementation of the 'Do It Right Away' policy, which emphasized swift and efficient government action and became a defining feature of his administrative approach [Data: Entities (233)].

In early 1991, shortly after beginning his work in Fuzhou, Xi's administration proposed the Changle Airport project to serve the city [Data: Entities (235)]. The project received speedy approval, indicating Xi's effectiveness in navigating bureaucratic processes and securing support for major initiatives. This rapid approval process may have reflected Xi's growing political influence and his ability to make compelling cases for development projects.

The airport opened in 1997, completing a six-year development cycle from proposal to operation [Data: Entities (235); Relationships (570)]. However, the project initially suffered losses after opening, revealing the challenges of large-scale infrastructure development and the gap that can exist between ambitious planning and immediate economic viability [Data: Entities (235)].

This dual background as both a former journalist with direct observational experience and a current academic gives Wu particular credibility in analyzing Xi's leadership. During his encounters with Xi in Fuzhou, Wu characterized him as cautious and bland in demeanor [Data: Entities (239)]. This assessment provides insight into Xi's personality and approach during this period, suggesting a measured and perhaps deliberately unremarkable public persona. The description of Xi as 'cautious' indicates a careful, risk-averse approach to leadership and public engagement, while 'bland' suggests he avoided controversial statements or dramatic gestures. Wu's observations were considered significant enough to be included in research on Chinese politics and leadership, with Wu being interviewed in February 2022 to share his recollections and professional analysis [Data: Entities (239)].

Chen Kai was a prominent Fuzhou crime boss who operated an extensive criminal enterprise involving illegal brothels and gambling dens [Data: Entities (248); Relationships (604)]. His criminal operations were characterized by widespread corruption, as he operated in collusion with approximately fifty government officials who facilitated or protected his illegal activities [Data: Entities (248)]. This extensive network of corrupt officials demonstrates how deeply criminal enterprises could penetrate governmental structures, representing a significant challenge to effective governance and rule of law. The scale of official involvement—fifty government officials—suggests systematic corruption rather than isolated incidents, indicating institutional weaknesses in oversight and accountability mechanisms. In 2005, Chen Kai was sentenced to death for his crimes, marking a significant case in China's efforts to combat organized crime and official corruption [Data: Entities (248)]. The severity of the sentence—capital punishment—reflects both the scale of his criminal operations and the Chinese legal system's approach to serious organized crime, particularly when it involves corruption of public officials.
