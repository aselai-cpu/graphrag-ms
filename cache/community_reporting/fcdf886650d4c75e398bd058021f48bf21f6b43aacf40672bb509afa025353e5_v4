The Japanese Army's invasion of China represents a defining element of the Second Sino-Japanese War, with devastating consequences for the Chinese population [Data: Entities (122); Relationships (269)]. The most notorious atrocity from this period was the Nanjing Massacre of 1937-1938, a mass killing and war crime perpetrated by Japanese troops in the Chinese city of Nanjing [Data: Entities (742, 2628); Relationships (2110, 7211)]. This event holds such profound importance in Chinese national memory that China has enacted a heroes and martyrs law specifically to protect the Nanjing Massacre from insult or denial [Data: Relationships (2110)].

In 2013, China unilaterally declared an air defense identification zone (ADIZ) over the East China Sea, a move that drew international objections and represented a significant assertion of Chinese territorial claims and military presence in the region [Data: Entities (914)]. The most persistent point of contention involves a group of islands within the East China Sea, known as the Diaoyu Islands in Chinese and the Senkaku Islands in Japanese, with both China and Japan asserting sovereignty over the territory [Data: Entities (914)]. These islands were claimed by Japan in the 1890s and have been administered by Japan since 1972, yet they remain disputed [Data: Entities (562)]. Territorial disputes in this region have emerged as a major flashpoint between Japan and China, leading to significant spikes in bilateral tensions and demonstrating how unresolved issues can quickly escalate [Data: Relationships (1840)].
