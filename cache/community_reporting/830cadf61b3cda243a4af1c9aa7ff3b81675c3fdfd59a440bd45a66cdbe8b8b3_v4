In a 2019 interview, Diess claimed to be unaware of the detention camps in Xinjiang, despite widespread international reporting on these facilities [Data: Entities (658); Relationships (1834)]. This claim of ignorance was particularly noteworthy given that Volkswagen maintained business operations and interests in China, including in the Xinjiang region itself [Data: Relationships (1834)].

During the Third Reich, which governed Germany from 1933 to 1945 under Adolf Hitler's leadership, Volkswagen was among the companies that utilized forced labor, reflecting the broader pattern of labor exploitation that characterized the Nazi regime's economic policies [Data: Entities (461)]. The Third Reich engaged in widespread exploitation of forced labor across various sectors of the German economy and war effort, with Volkswagen's operations involving the exploitation of workers who were compelled to work against their will [Data: Entities (461)]. This historical legacy of corporate complicity in human rights violations during the Nazi era creates a particularly stark context for evaluating Volkswagen's contemporary operations in Xinjiang, where similar concerns about forced labor and detention camps have been raised [Data: Entities (461, 657)]. The historical examination of the Third Reich continues to serve as a crucial reminder of the dangers of totalitarianism and the importance of corporate responsibility, making Volkswagen's current stance in Xinjiang especially significant given the company's own history [Data: Entities (461)].

However, this economic relationship has been accompanied by deteriorating public sentiment, with unfavorable views of China in Germany reaching record levels in 2020 [Data: Entities (385); Relationships (3126)]. This shift in German public opinion toward China mirrors broader trends across Western nations during that period, suggesting growing concerns about China's domestic policies and international behavior [Data: Entities (385)]. Germany's position as both an economic benchmark that China has surpassed and a Western nation where public opinion toward China has soured illustrates the complex and sometimes contradictory nature of contemporary Germany-China relations [Data: Entities (385)]. The country serves as a useful demographic comparison point when discussing the scale of China's Communist Party, as Germany's entire population is smaller than the membership of the Communist Party of China, helping illustrate the massive organizational scale of Chinese political institutions relative to entire Western nations [Data: Entities (385)].
