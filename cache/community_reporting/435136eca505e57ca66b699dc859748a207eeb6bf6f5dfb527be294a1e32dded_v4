The community structure is relatively small but focused, consisting of the historian's institutional base in Munich and their analytical work examining Xi Jinping's approach to ethnic policies and party leadership.

This specialization positions Oidtmann within a critical area of contemporary Chinese studies, as ethnic policy represents one of the most sensitive and consequential aspects of governance in China. The historian's work involves analyzing complex political dynamics that have significant implications for millions of people across China's diverse ethnic regions. The focus on ethnic policy suggests engagement with issues affecting Uyghurs, Tibetans, Mongolians, and other minority groups within China's borders.

This focus on Xi Jinping is particularly significant given the Chinese leader's consolidation of power and the marked shifts in ethnic policy that have occurred during his tenure. The relationship between Oidtmann and Xi Jinping as a subject of study indicates scholarly engagement with contemporary Chinese political developments at the highest level. Xi Jinping's leadership has been characterized by distinctive approaches to ethnic governance, including increased emphasis on assimilation policies, security measures in ethnic minority regions, and centralized control over ethnic affairs. Oidtmann's analytical work on these policies provides external scholarly perspective on decisions and implementations that affect geopolitical relations, human rights discussions, and international perceptions of China's domestic governance.

The positioning of this analytical work in Munich, a major German city with strong academic institutions, places the research within the European context of China studies. Munich has historically been home to significant academic institutions and research centers, providing infrastructure and intellectual community for specialized scholarship. The location in Germany, a country with substantial economic and political engagement with China, adds context to the analytical work being conducted.
