Under Chiang Kai-shek's leadership, Kuomintang forces inflicted substantial losses on the Red Army and executed Communist leaders such as Fang Zhimin in 1935 [Data: Entities (701)]. Despite these tactical victories, the Kuomintang ultimately lost the civil war and fled to Taiwan in 1949, bringing with them many mainlanders known as waishengren [Data: Entities (701, 874)]. This retreat fundamentally altered Taiwan's demographic and political landscape, as many waishengren were Kuomintang members and supporters who became a significant political constituency [Data: Relationships (2548)]. The party's relocation to Taiwan marked the beginning of a fifty-five-year period of authoritarian rule that lasted until 2000, during which the Kuomintang maintained its claim as the legitimate government of all China and pursued Project National Glory to retake the mainland [Data: Entities (701)].\"}, {\"summary\": \"Evolution from Military Adversary to Diplomatic Partner with Beijing\", \"explanation\": \"The Kuomintang's relationship with mainland China has undergone a remarkable transformation from bitter military enmity to diplomatic engagement. During the civil war period, the Kuomintang and Red Army were locked in deadly combat, with the Nationalist Party fighting Communist forces including those led by Xi Zhongxun [Data: Entities (119, 135)]. The Red Army suffered significant defeats at Kuomintang hands before Mao Zedong's rise to leadership at the 1935 conference [Data: Entities (135)]. However, over subsequent decades, the Kuomintang gradually shed its historical antagonism toward the Communist Party and began advocating for warmer relations with Beijing based on a shared belief in 'one China' [Data: Entities (701)]. This evolution culminated in the 1992 Consensus, a tacit understanding between Chinese and Taiwanese representatives that both sides agreed there is 'one China' without defining what that meant [Data: Entities (879)]. Beijing participated in these consensus discussions with Taiwan, establishing a framework for cross-strait dialogue [Data: Relationships (2570)]. This diplomatic shift represents a fundamental reorientation from the party's original mission of defeating Communist forces to engaging them as negotiating partners.\"}, {\"summary\": \"International Recognition Shift and UN Expulsion\", \"explanation\": \"The Kuomintang experienced a dramatic loss of international legitimacy when the United Nations General Assembly passed a landmark resolution in 1971 to eject the Kuomintang delegation and recognize the People's Republic of China instead [Data: Entities (981); Relationships (2926)]. This diplomatic setback marked a critical turning point in the international community's recognition of which government legitimately represented China. Prior to this expulsion, the Kuomintang was recognized by most countries as China's rightful government [Data: Entities (701)]. The UN decision reflected the shifting global political landscape and the growing acceptance of the Communist government in Beijing as the legitimate representative of the Chinese people. This loss of international standing fundamentally undermined the Kuomintang's claim to be the government of all China and forced a gradual reassessment of the party's identity and objectives, contributing to its eventual evolution from a government-in-exile claiming mainland sovereignty to a political party focused on governing Taiwan.\"}, {\"summary\": \"World War II Role and Historical Legitimacy Claims\", \"explanation\": \"The Kuomintang's historical legitimacy rests partly on its role during World War II, when its Nationalist armies under Chiang Kai-shek's leadership defended China against Japanese attackers. According to scholarly consensus outside mainland China, Kuomintang armies did most of the fighting during World War II, bearing the brunt of combat against Japanese forces [Data: Relationships (1984)]. This wartime contribution provided the party with significant moral authority and international recognition during and immediately after the conflict. The Kuomintang's military efforts during this period contrasted with the Communist forces' more limited engagement with Japanese troops, a historical distinction that the party has emphasized to bolster its legitimacy claims. However, despite this wartime service, the party's fortunes changed dramatically during the subsequent civil war, where it ultimately lost to Communist forces despite its earlier military successes [Data: Entities (701)]. The party's World War II record remains an important element of its historical narrative and identity, particularly in Taiwan where it governed for over five decades.\"}, {\"summary\": \"Red Army Transformation and Institutional Development\", \"explanation\": \"The Red Army underwent a dramatic transformation from a struggling revolutionary force suffering defeats at Kuomintang hands to an institutionalized military power that eventually became the People's Liberation Army (PLA). The Red Army was the predecessor or component of the PLA, representing the military foundation of Communist China [Data: Relationships (317)]. During the civil war period, the Red Army experienced significant military setbacks and losses in battles against the Kuomintang before Mao Zedong seized control at the pivotal 1935 conference, historically known as the Zunyi Conference [Data: Entities (135)]. This conference marked a turning point in both the Red Army's military fortunes and Mao's rise to leadership within the Chinese Communist Party. The Red Army's growing institutional stability was demonstrated in 1947 when the Bayi School was founded specifically to educate the children of Red Army officials, symbolizing the military force's established position within the emerging Communist state structure [Data: Entities (135)].

The Control Yuan served as a supervisory and auditory branch within the governmental structure, reflecting the party's commitment to Sun Yat-sen's vision of a modern Chinese state. This implementation demonstrated the Kuomintang's attempt to create a distinctive governmental system that drew on both traditional Chinese concepts of governance and modern political structures. The establishment of the Control Yuan represented the party's efforts to legitimize its rule through institutional innovation and adherence to the founding principles of its ideological father, Sun Yat-sen.
