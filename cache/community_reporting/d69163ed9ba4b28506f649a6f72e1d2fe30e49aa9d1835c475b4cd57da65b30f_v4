According to historical sources and popular accounts, Yongzheng allegedly doctored his father Emperor Kangxi's succession edict to secure his position as emperor [Data: Entities (693)]. The specific allegation suggests that Yongzheng changed the identity of the intended successor from Yinti, the fourteenth prince, to himself [Data: Relationships (3570)]. This controversy has become one of the most enduring disputes in Qing Dynasty history, with questions and disputes surrounding the legitimacy of Yinzhen's succession persisting through centuries [Data: Entities (1157)]. The allegations have been serious enough to warrant continued scholarly attention, with modern authors like Shangguan Yun writing specifically about whether Yongzheng doctored his father Kangxi's edict [Data: Entities (2503)]. This controversy reflects the high stakes and intense competition that characterized imperial succession during the Qing Dynasty, where the transfer of power could determine the fate of the empire and the fortunes of entire princely factions.\"}, {\"summary\": \"Yinreng's Failed Crown Prince Designation\", \"explanation\": \"The succession crisis was precipitated by the spectacular failure of Yinreng, who had been designated crown prince at the extraordinarily young age of one year old by Emperor Kangxi [Data: Entities (1154)]. This early appointment, rather than ensuring a smooth succession, created decades of political turmoil within the imperial family. Yinreng's designation led to intense rivalry among Kangxi's other sons, who split into competing factions and cliques as they battled for power and influence at court [Data: Entities (1154)]. Most remarkably, Yinreng was deposed from his position as crown prince not once, but twice during his lifetime, attributed to what historical records describe as moral frailties and character flaws that made him unsuitable to inherit the throne [Data: Entities (1154); Relationships (3599)]. Following Yinreng's repeated failures and ultimate removal from the line of succession, the Kangxi Emperor eventually settled on Yinzhen as his successor [Data: Relationships (3599)]. This unprecedented situation of deposing a crown prince twice demonstrates the severity of the succession crisis and the complex political dynamics that ultimately led to Yongzheng's controversial ascension to power.\"}, {\"summary\": \"Yinti as the Alleged Intended Heir\", \"explanation\": \"Yinti, the fourteenth prince, occupies a crucial position in the succession controversy as the figure who, according to popular myths and historical speculation, was allegedly the intended successor chosen by the Kangxi Emperor before his death [Data: Entities (1158)]. These accounts suggest that Yinzhen may have altered Kangxi's succession edict to claim the throne for himself instead of Yinti, changing the successor's identity from Yinti to himself [Data: Entities (1158); Relationships (3570)]. The story of Yinti's alleged displacement as heir represents one of the most enduring controversies in Qing Dynasty history, reflecting the complex and often contentious nature of imperial succession during this period [Data: Entities (1158)]. Whether Yinti was truly the legitimate intended heir or simply a figure around whom myths developed remains a matter of debate among historians [Data: Entities (1158)]. The persistence of this narrative in both popular culture and historical discourse demonstrates how succession disputes could generate lasting questions about legitimacy and proper governance, questions that would influence how subsequent Qing emperors approached the critical issue of naming their successors.\"}, {\"summary\": \"Institutional Reforms in Succession Practices\", \"explanation\": \"The succession crisis that brought Yongzheng to power had profound institutional consequences for the Qing Dynasty's governance. One of Yongzheng's most notable contributions to Qing Dynasty governance was the creation of a secret succession practice, an innovative system designed to prevent the power struggles and conflicts that had plagued previous imperial successions, including his own controversial ascension [Data: Entities (693)]. Under this new practice, the emperor would conceal the identity of his chosen heir behind a tablet, keeping the succession decision secret until after his death [Data: Entities (693)]. This method aimed to reduce court intrigue and ensure a smoother transition of power, directly addressing the factional conflicts and succession disputes that had characterized the later years of Kangxi's reign [Data: Entities (693)]. The story of Yinreng's early designation and subsequent failures illustrated the dangers of early succession planning in imperial China, where the public designation of an heir apparent could create decades of political instability and family conflict [Data: Entities (1154)]. Yinreng's case became one of the most notable examples of a failed crown prince in Chinese history, and the succession crisis that surrounded him contributed significantly to the later adoption of the secret succession system [Data: Entities (1154)].

These television productions brought renewed public interest to his life and reign, introducing the Qing emperor to contemporary audiences and sparking widespread fascination with his story [Data: Entities (693)]. The portrayal of Yongzheng in these popular dramas likely explored both his political achievements and the controversies surrounding his succession, making him one of the most recognizable Qing emperors in modern Chinese popular culture [Data: Entities (693)].
