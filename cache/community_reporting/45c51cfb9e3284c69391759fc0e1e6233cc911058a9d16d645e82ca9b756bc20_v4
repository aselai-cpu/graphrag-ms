The network includes Mao's designated successor Hua Guofeng, Mao's wife Jiang Qing who led the radical Gang of Four faction, and the pivotal bloodless coup that toppled this faction. The relationships reveal a complex power struggle where Hua Guofeng, selected by Mao as his successor, orchestrated the arrest of the Gang of Four shortly after Mao's death, consolidating his position before eventually being replaced by Deng Xiaoping.

The death of China's paramount leader created a power vacuum that multiple factions sought to fill, leading to immediate political maneuvering and conflict.

By arranging for the arrest of the Gang of Four shortly after Mao's death, Hua prevented potential political chaos and effectively ended the radical faction's influence over Chinese politics [Data: Entities (186, 29)].
