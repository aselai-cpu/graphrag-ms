Both journalists co-authored an article examining journalist qualifications in China, indicating a working partnership focused on Chinese media policy and regulations [Data: Entities (1984, 1985)]. This collaboration suggests a coordinated approach to covering complex international journalism issues, particularly those related to press freedom and professional standards in China. The partnership between these two journalists allows for more comprehensive reporting on sensitive topics that benefit from multiple perspectives and shared research efforts.

The fact that both Mia Li and Bree Feng wrote about this specific subject indicates specialized knowledge and interest in Chinese media policy and the regulatory environment governing journalism in China. Journalist qualifications in China are a critical issue because they relate to government control over who can practice journalism, what credentials are required, and how foreign journalists are permitted to operate within Chinese borders. This reporting likely examines the barriers to press freedom, the credentialing process for journalists, and the implications of China's media regulations on both domestic and international news coverage.
