The strategy's rigidity and its pervasive impact on daily life, economic activity, and personal freedoms generated mounting frustration among Chinese citizens.

The relationship between this policy and China itself demonstrates how a national-level public health strategy became a source of systemic tension, ultimately proving unsustainable in the face of public resistance.
