This military dimension includes continuous monitoring of China's military developments, sending warships to challenge territorial claims in the South China Sea, and maintaining extensive security alliances throughout Asia. The competition extends beyond traditional military concerns to encompass economic warfare, with the U.S. engaging in a significant trade war involving disputes over technology, tariffs, and trade practices [Data: Entities (68); Relationships (143)].\\n\\nThe technological dimension of this competition has become particularly acute, with the United States implementing semiconductor export restrictions through legislation like the CHIPS Act and other controls aimed at limiting China's technological advancement.

The Kosovo War in 1999 particularly worried Beijing about Washington's willingness to intervene militarily in regional conflicts, with Chinese officials viewing the NATO intervention as evidence that the U.S. might similarly intervene in a potential Taiwan conflict.

His administration also stepped up security cooperation with Taiwan, signed legislation imposing sanctions related to Hong Kong, and issued executive orders barring American investment in Chinese firms supporting China's military.
