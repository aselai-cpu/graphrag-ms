His appointment as Interpol president in 2016 represented a significant achievement for China in extending its influence within international institutions [Data: Entities (464)]. This dual role gave Meng considerable authority over both China's domestic security apparatus and the world's largest international police organization. The Ministry of Public Security is one of China's most powerful government agencies, wielding significant authority over domestic security matters, law enforcement operations, and social stability maintenance [Data: Entities (1213)]. Meng's position as Vice Minister placed him at the upper echelons of this influential organization, while his Interpol presidency gave him a platform on the global stage.

His sudden vanishing while traveling from France, where Interpol is headquartered in Lyon, to China sparked widespread concern and confusion [Data: Entities (462, 463); Relationships (1267, 1272)]. The disappearance was particularly alarming because it involved the head of the world's primary international police cooperation organization, raising questions about the safety and independence of international officials with ties to authoritarian governments. Following his disappearance, it was revealed that Meng had been placed under investigation by China's National Supervisory Commission for violating the law, with allegations focusing on corruption and abuse of power [Data: Entities (462)]. The investigation led to serious charges related to bribery and other corrupt practices. Meng was subsequently expelled from the Communist Party of China, a severe political punishment that stripped him of his party membership and standing [Data: Entities (462)].

The Ministry of Public Security, where Meng served as Vice Minister, was subject to particularly extensive purges under Xi Jinping's leadership [Data: Entities (465, 1213)]. These purges were part of a broader effort to eliminate corruption within Chinese government institutions and the Communist Party [Data: Entities (1213); Relationships (4773)]. Meng himself had led a corrupt political clique within the Ministry of Public Security, which was subsequently broken up during Xi's anti-corruption drive [Data: Entities (1213)]. The Ministry of Public Security operates under the governance of the Communist Party, making it subject to party discipline and political campaigns [Data: Relationships (4773)]. The reach of China's National Supervisory Commission, which investigated Meng, demonstrates the government's capacity to investigate corruption and misconduct among public officials at all levels, regardless of their domestic or international prominence [Data: Entities (462)].

Interpol, as an international police organization responsible for global law enforcement coordination and issuing red notices to locate and detain fugitives, found itself at the center of a political controversy [Data: Entities (464)]. China's successful installation of Meng Hongwei as Interpol president in 2016 represented a significant development in China's influence within international law enforcement institutions [Data: Entities (464)]. However, his subsequent disappearance while serving as president of the global police agency raised serious questions about the independence and integrity of international institutions when their leaders maintain strong ties to authoritarian governments [Data: Entities (462, 464)]. The incident highlighted the complex challenges of international law enforcement cooperation when member states have vastly different political systems and legal frameworks. Interpol's headquarters in Lyon, France, became a focal point of international attention as Meng's wife resided there and the organization grappled with the sudden absence of its president [Data: Entities (463); Relationships (1267, 1272)].

These initiatives reflect the Ministry's dual role in both maintaining law enforcement operations and shaping the professional standards and ethical framework for public security personnel throughout China [Data: Entities (1213)].
