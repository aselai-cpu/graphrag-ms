This analytical approach recognizes that political power is not solely maintained through coercion or material incentives, but also through the creation and dissemination of compelling narratives that shape how people understand their political reality. Apter's work explores how these narratives function to persuade audiences, mobilize supporters, and legitimize political authority. The focus on narrative construction as a political tool represents an important contribution to political science, as it highlights the cultural and communicative dimensions of political power. By examining how communist movements have employed storytelling techniques, Apter's research reveals the sophisticated methods through which ideological movements create coherent worldviews, identify enemies and allies, and motivate collective action.
