His findings demonstrated that the top 20 percent of households controlled more than two-thirds of the nation's disposable income, highlighting extreme economic disparity [Data: Entities (568)]. This research provided empirical evidence of wealth concentration patterns that had important implications for understanding China's economic structure. Gan Li's work calculated China's Gini coefficient at 0.61, a measurement indicating substantial income inequality [Data: Entities (568); Relationships (1589)]. The Gini coefficient, which ranges from 0 (perfect equality) to 1 (maximum inequality), placed China among countries with significant economic inequality concerns.
