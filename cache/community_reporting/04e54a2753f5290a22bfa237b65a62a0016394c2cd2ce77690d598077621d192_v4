This earlier period was characterized by Deng Xiaoping's doctrine of 'hide your strength, bide your time,' which counseled strategic patience and avoiding confrontation [Data: Entities (961)].\\n\\nUnder Xi Jinping's leadership, this approach has been fundamentally reversed. Xi has urged the foreign ministry to 'strive and accomplish things' and to vigorously enforce Communist Party narratives in diplomatic engagements [Data: Entities (670)]. Officials like Qi called for combativeness in Chinese diplomacy, which manifested prominently in social media activities by foreign ministry spokesmen like Zhao Lijian [Data: Entities (1011); Relationships (3091)].\\n\\nThis transformation is embodied in the 'wolf warrior' diplomatic style, named after a popular Chinese action film series. The BBC characterized Zhao Lijian as exemplifying this wolf warrior psyche among Beijing's diplomats [Data: Entities (965); Relationships (2860)]. This approach involves acerbic takedowns of Western powers, aggressive defense of Chinese positions, and willingness to engage in direct confrontation with foreign officials and media [Data: Entities (961, 1010)]. The appointment of party specialists like Qi Yu to senior foreign ministry positions, despite lacking traditional diplomatic experience, further demonstrates the prioritization of ideological commitment and combativeness over conventional diplomatic skills [Data: Entities (1004); Relationships (3044)].]\"}], \"rating\": 8.5, \"rating_explanation\": \"This community represents a high-impact network involving major global powers, international media, and the transformation of diplomatic norms, with significant implications for international relations, information warfare, freedom of expression, and geopolitical stability.\"}"}, "metrics": {"attempted_request_count": 1, "successful_response_count": 0, "failed_response_count": 0, "responses_with_tokens": 1, "prompt_tokens": 9107, "completion_tokens": 4048, "total_tokens": 13155, "compute_duration_seconds": 99.95827293395996, "streaming_responses": 0, "retries": 0, "requests_with_retries": 0}}}
