The Houston Rockets had previously enjoyed significant popularity in China, particularly during Yao Ming's tenure with the team from 2002 to 2011, but this relationship was severely damaged by the Hong Kong tweet incident, resulting in boycott threats and widespread backlash that affected both the team and the broader NBA's standing in one of its most important international markets.\", \"findings\": [{\"summary\": \"The Houston Rockets' transformation from popular franchise to controversial entity in China\", \"explanation\": \"The Houston Rockets experienced a dramatic reversal in their relationship with China, shifting from being a highly popular NBA franchise to becoming the target of significant backlash and boycott threats.
