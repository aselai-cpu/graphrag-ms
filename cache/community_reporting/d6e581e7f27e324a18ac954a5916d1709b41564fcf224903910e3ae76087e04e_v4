The crisis involved severe economic retaliation from China, including trade restrictions and the recall of diplomatic representation from Vilnius. The European Union played a crucial supporting role by launching a World Trade Organization case against China for discriminatory trade practices. Key actors include Lithuania as the primary target of Chinese pressure, China as the retaliating power, the EU and European Union as Lithuania's institutional defenders, Vilnius as the location of the controversial Taiwan representative office, and Foreign Minister Gabrielius Landsbergis as a key decision-maker.

This regional initiative was designed by China to enhance its economic and political influence across Central and Eastern Europe through investment and trade partnerships. Lithuania's departure represented a fundamental shift in its approach to relations with Beijing and marked a break from the regional cooperation mechanism that China had carefully cultivated to expand its presence in Europe [Data: Entities (1097); Relationships (3354)].\\n\\nThe withdrawal was orchestrated under the leadership of Foreign Minister Gabrielius Landsbergis, who played a key role in this strategic pivot away from Chinese-led regional frameworks [Data: Entities (2431); Relationships (6637)]. This decision was particularly significant because it demonstrated Lithuania's willingness to prioritize its foreign policy independence and values over potential economic benefits from participation in Chinese-led initiatives. The move signaled to both China and other European nations that Lithuania was prepared to take principled stances even when facing a major global power.\\n\\nLithuania's withdrawal from the 17+1 bloc became emblematic of broader concerns among some European nations about the nature and intentions of Chinese economic engagement in the region.

The establishment of the representative office in Vilnius was viewed by China as a serious challenge to its core interests regarding territorial integrity and sovereignty. This move was particularly sensitive because it went beyond the informal, low-profile relationships that many countries maintain with Taiwan, instead signaling a more open and robust engagement [Data: Entities (1097); Relationships (3354)].\\n\\nThe Taiwan office opening demonstrated Lithuania's commitment to supporting democratic values and engaging with like-minded partners, even when such actions contradicted the preferences of major powers.
