As a Chinese-American academic holding Singapore Permanent Residence status, Huang Jing was expelled and banned from returning to Singapore based on allegations that he had been working as an agent of influence for China [Data: Entities (1133); Relationships (3489)].

The coordinated nature of these cancellations suggests that Yang Xiuping and Huang Jing were involved in related activities or were part of the same foreign influence operation [Data: Entities (2478)].\\n\\nThe Ministry of Home Affairs, as Singapore's government organization responsible for internal security and immigration, played the central role in executing these cancellations [Data: Entities (2473); Relationships (6703)]. The simultaneous action against both individuals represents a significant exercise of Singapore's authority to revoke permanent residence status when national security concerns arise. This coordinated approach demonstrates Singapore's capability to identify and respond to networked foreign influence operations rather than treating such cases as isolated incidents.\\n\\nThe cancellation of permanent residence status is a serious administrative action typically reserved for cases involving substantial breaches of immigration regulations or national security concerns [Data: Entities (2478)].
