The network consists of several merchants and business associates, including a Red-Faced Gentleman, a Man with Large Chin (also identified as a Great Fat Man), and a First Speaker who claims to have been Old Scratch's particular friend. The community is characterized by its mercenary attitudes toward the deceased, with conversations focusing primarily on financial matters such as inheritance, funeral costs, and what happened to the deceased's money rather than expressing genuine grief. Scrooge appears as a peripheral figure who knew these men and may have connections to Old Scratch.

The Man with Large Chin exemplifies this attitude, as he is depicted as someone who yawned during conversations about the deceased, suggesting a casual or indifferent demeanor toward the somber topic [Data: Entities (134)].\\n\\nThis character's primary concern appears to be financial rather than emotional, as he specifically notes that the deceased has not left him any money in their will or estate. His focus remains on practical matters, particularly the deceased person's money and funeral arrangements, rather than expressing grief or offering condolences [Data: Entities (134)].

However, the emphasis on being \\\"disinterested\\\" may reveal that even this purported friendship was not particularly deep or emotionally invested.\\n\\nThe First Speaker's peculiar characteristics—refusing to wear black gloves (traditional mourning attire) and never eating lunch—further underscore the unusual nature of relationships within this business community.
