The implementation of comprehensive police service stations in Shijiazhuang City represents a localized application of broader reform efforts [Data: Entities (1726)]. This geographic specificity suggests that Shijiazhuang City may have served as a pilot location or model city for testing policing reforms before potential wider deployment across Hebei Province or other regions of China.
