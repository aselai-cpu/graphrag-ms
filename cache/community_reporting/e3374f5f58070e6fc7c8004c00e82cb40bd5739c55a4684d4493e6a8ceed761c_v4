This decade-long movement resulted in violent purges, millions of deaths, and near civil war conditions across China [Data: Entities (30)]. The revolution tore Chinese society apart and wreaked havoc throughout the nation, with the Red Guards engaging in political indoctrination and violent activities as fervent enforcers of the movement's bloody excesses [Data: Entities (30, 161)]. The economic impact was catastrophic, as the Cultural Revolution wiped out economic gains made in the early 1960s and shattered China's economy [Data: Entities (30); Relationships (210)].
