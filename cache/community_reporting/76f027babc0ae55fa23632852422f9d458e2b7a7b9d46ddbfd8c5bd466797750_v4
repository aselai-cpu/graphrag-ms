The community consists of three key entities: Sixth Tone as the central media outlet, China as the subject of coverage, and Xue Yujie as a contributing journalist. The relationships demonstrate a journalistic network where Sixth Tone reports on significant Chinese educational policies, including the ban on imported textbooks and the emergence of a private tutoring black market following government crackdowns.

This reporting, authored by Xue Yujie in January 2020, highlights the government's regulatory approach to education and its emphasis on controlling the ideological and informational content that students encounter in their academic studies [Data: Entities (2055)].
