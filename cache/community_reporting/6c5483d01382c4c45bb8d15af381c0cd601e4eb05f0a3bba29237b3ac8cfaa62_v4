Installed as General Secretary by Deng Xiaoping in 1981, he was known for his progressive approach to governance and notably attempted to establish clearer boundaries between the party and state apparatus [Data: Entities (222)].

He was unseated from his position as General Secretary in January 1987 by party conservatives in Beijing, having been deposed by Deng Xiaoping [Data: Entities (222); Relationships (542)]. The official reasons for his removal centered on allegations that he had mishandled student protests occurring in 1986 and 1987, as well as concerns about his management of economic reforms.

The irony of Hu Yaobang's legacy is profound: while he was removed from power for allegedly being too lenient with dissent, his death ironically triggered the very type of mass protest movement that had led to his political downfall.

Originally resurrected in 1986, the Ministry was established with the specific purpose of monitoring government workers and ensuring accountability within the state apparatus [Data: Entities (346)].

This merger effectively integrated government oversight functions back into the party's disciplinary apparatus, reflecting the Chinese Communist Party's approach to maintaining unified control over both party and government personnel through consolidated oversight mechanisms.
