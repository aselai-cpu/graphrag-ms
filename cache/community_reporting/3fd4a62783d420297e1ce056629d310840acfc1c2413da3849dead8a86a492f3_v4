Established historically by the Kuomintang (KMT), the Republic of China government relocated to Taiwan in 1949 after losing the Chinese Civil War to Communist forces on the mainland. This relocation marked a defining moment in Chinese history, as the government under Chiang Kai-shek established its administration on Taiwan, which it had absorbed from Japanese colonial rule in 1945 [Data: Entities (702)]. The Republic of China maintains comprehensive governmental structures including legislative, executive, and defense institutions, all of which are represented in this community.
