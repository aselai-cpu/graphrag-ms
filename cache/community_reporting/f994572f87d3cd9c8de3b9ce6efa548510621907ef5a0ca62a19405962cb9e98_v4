Sparked by mourning following the death of reformist leader Hu Yaobang in April 1989, the protests quickly escalated into a broad-based challenge to Communist Party authority [Data: Entities (34)]. At their peak, as many as a million people rallied in Tiananmen Square to demand greater political freedoms, driven by public anger over inflation and corruption [Data: Entities (34)]. The movement's scale was unprecedented, inspiring similar demonstrations across China, including in Fujian province, and drawing support from Hong Kongers [Data: Entities (34)]. The violent suppression of these protests on June 4, 1989, through military force ordered by Deng Xiaoping, resulted in significant casualties and became known as the June 4 massacre [Data: Entities (34)]. The international response was immediate and severe, with the United States and European nations imposing sanctions against Beijing, representing what was then the highest levels of global anti-China sentiment [Data: Entities (34)].
