Beginning in summer 2018, Xu published essays directly criticizing Xi Jinping's consolidation of power and China's authoritarian turn, representing a rare act of public dissent from within China's academic establishment [Data: Entities (1215); Relationships (3748)]. His criticism of Xi Jinping's autocratic governance style led to immediate and severe consequences, including suspension from his teaching position, salary reduction, and ultimately his dismissal from Tsinghua University [Data: Entities (1215); Relationships (3748)]. The situation escalated in July 2020 when Xu was detained for six days on prostitution charges that many observers viewed as politically motivated given the timing and context of his criticism [Data: Entities (1215)]. Despite these consequences, Xu fought against the charges and contested his dismissal, demonstrating continued resistance to what he and supporters viewed as political persecution [Data: Entities (1215)].

This case has been widely cited as an example of constraints on academic freedom and free speech within Chinese universities, particularly regarding criticism of the country's leadership [Data: Entities (183)].

This militant group engaged in violent skirmishes during the Cultural Revolution, representing an extreme manifestation of political radicalism [Data: Entities (188)]. The violence reached its peak during the Hundred Day War in 1968, an infamous violent skirmish waged by Red Guard factions on the Tsinghua campus [Data: Entities (190); Relationships (452, 454)]. Kuai Dafu, a Tsinghua undergraduate, emerged as a Red Guard leader and waged violent skirmishes against rival factions during this period [Data: Entities (184); Relationships (446)]. During the Cultural Revolution, Tsinghua admitted worker-peasant-soldier students through political screening rather than traditional academic merit, fundamentally altering the institution's character [Data: Entities (183)].

While the methods have changed from revolutionary violence to administrative punishment, both periods demonstrate the Chinese state's intolerance of political dissent and its willingness to use educational institutions as sites for enforcing political orthodoxy [Data: Entities (183, 1215)].
