The county is a poor agricultural area in Hebei province with a population of approximately four hundred thousand people, providing Xi with direct exposure to the challenges faced by rural China [Data: Entities (207); Relationships (496)]. Xi Jinping served in Zhengding in two progressive leadership roles: first as deputy party secretary and subsequently as party chief. This progression through increasingly responsible positions in a rural agricultural setting allowed him to develop practical administrative skills and establish his credentials as a capable leader in one of China's agricultural regions [Data: Entities (207)]. The formative nature of this experience is underscored by the fact that Xi later returned to visit Zhengding after his time serving there, demonstrating the lasting personal and political significance of his years in the county.

Jia Dashan was a respected figure in Zhengding's cultural and literary landscape, holding significant standing in the community due to his dual roles as both a creative artist and public administrator [Data: Entities (209); Relationships (499)]. When Xi and Jia Dashan first met, the local novelist greeted Xi with disdain, suggesting initial skepticism or dismissiveness toward the newcomer to Zhengding's leadership.

However, Xi was able to fundamentally transform this relationship over time, eventually winning over Jia Dashan through his character, leadership approach, or vision for the region. This shift was so significant that Xi subsequently nominated Jia Dashan to serve as director of Zhengding's culture bureau, a position that would leverage both his literary credentials and administrative experience [Data: Entities (209)].
