The community is characterized by tensions between economic interdependence with China and concerns over territorial sovereignty in the South China Sea, with Southeast Asia serving as a critical arena for US-China great-power competition.

These proposed modifications to official statements reflect ASEAN's attempt to balance its economic interests with China against concerns about Chinese influence and assertiveness in Southeast Asia. The territorial tensions are particularly acute because China's expansive claims in the South China Sea overlap with the claims of several ASEAN member states, including Vietnam, the Philippines, Malaysia, and Brunei [Data: Relationships (3458)]. Five Southeast Asian nations assert sovereignty and economic rights in the South China Sea that overlap with Beijing's territorial claims, making the region a focal point where major power interests intersect [Data: Entities (226)].

Laos is a recipient of Chinese largesse and frequently sides with Beijing on South China Sea issues at ASEAN, despite not being a claimant state itself [Data: Entities (1115); Relationships (3412)]. This alignment reflects the broader pattern of Chinese influence in Southeast Asia through economic engagement and diplomatic cooperation, demonstrating how economic dependence can translate into political support on contentious regional issues. The personal diplomatic ties between Laos and Chinese leadership have been cultivated at the highest levels, with Xi Jinping receiving special recognition from Laotian leaders who marked his birthday during his visit to Laos when he served as vice president of China [Data: Entities (1115)]. This gesture underscores the warm bilateral relations and the importance Laos places on its relationship with Chinese leadership, both symbolically and practically. Laos's position is particularly significant because in September 2016, the country held the ASEAN chairmanship during the Non-Aligned Movement summit, demonstrating its active role in regional multilateral organizations [Data: Entities (1115)]. While serving in leadership roles within ASEAN, Laos has demonstrated its willingness to align with Chinese interests on contentious regional issues, which has implications for ASEAN unity and the organization's ability to present a cohesive stance on matters such as the South China Sea disputes [Data: Entities (1115)].

ASEAN has been referenced in the broader context of US-China competition, indicating the organization's strategic importance in the geopolitical landscape of the Asia-Pacific region [Data: Entities (1117)]. As major powers compete for influence in Southeast Asia, ASEAN finds itself positioned at the center of these dynamics, serving as a forum through which member states can navigate complex international relationships while maintaining regional stability and autonomy. The region's strategic significance stems not only from its large population and economic potential but also from its geographic position and the contested waters of the South China Sea, where overlapping territorial claims and vital shipping lanes have made the region essential to both regional stability and global commerce [Data: Entities (226)].

This approach demonstrates how China utilizes soft power and cultural diplomacy to complement its economic engagement in the region. The region has been the site of significant diplomatic activity by Chinese leadership, with Xi Jinping conducting visits to Southeast Asian nations, including Laos, as part of China's broader engagement strategy in the region [Data: Entities (226)]. China has established formal diplomatic relations with various Southeast Asian nations, including Singapore, demonstrating the region's importance to Chinese foreign policy objectives [Data: Entities (226)]. These historical and cultural ties provide China with unique advantages in its engagement with Southeast Asia, creating networks of influence that extend beyond formal state-to-state relations.
