As a recognized 501(c)(3) educational corporation, the Foundation can operate without paying federal income taxes on donations and other revenue related to its charitable mission [Data: Entities (154)]. This status is essential for the Foundation's financial sustainability, as it allows the organization to direct more resources toward its core mission of supporting Project Gutenberg rather than paying federal taxes.\\n\\nThe relationship between the Foundation and the Internal Revenue Service represents a crucial element of the community's structure. The IRS, as a U.S. federal agency responsible for tax administration and enforcement, has the authority to grant and maintain tax-exempt status for charitable organizations [Data: Entities (154); Relationships (414)].

Public domain status means these works are no longer protected by copyright restrictions within U.S. territory, allowing Project Gutenberg to legally digitize, archive, and distribute them freely to the public [Data: Relationships (396)]. U.S. copyright law establishes the rules for when works enter the public domain, typically based on factors such as publication date, author death date, and whether copyright was properly renewed under older copyright regimes [Data: Relationships (396)].\\n\\nProject Gutenberg eBooks can be used freely within the United States, where U.S. copyright law applies to determine the legal status and permissible uses of these works [Data: Entities (6)]. However, it is important to note that while Project Gutenberg operates under U.S. copyright law, the copyright status of works may differ in other countries. A work that is in the public domain in the United States may still be protected by copyright in other jurisdictions, which can affect the accessibility of Project Gutenberg's materials for international users [Data: Relationships (396)].
