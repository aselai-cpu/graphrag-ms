The organization has published comprehensive reports examining the Chinese Red Guards and the Cultural Revolution, a tumultuous period that occurred primarily during the 1960s and 1970s under Mao Zedong's leadership. Beyond historical coverage, NPR has also reported on current developments involving China's Communist Party, specifically covering stories about the party's targeting of young Marxists [Data: Entities (1773)]. This dual focus on historical and contemporary events positions NPR as an important source of information about China's political evolution and the ongoing relationship between the communist government and various political movements.

Kuhn specifically reported on Chinese Red Guards apologizing, a story that connects to the legacy of the Cultural Revolution and its lasting impact on Chinese society [Data: Entities (1970)]. The Red Guards were a mass student-led paramilitary social movement mobilized by Mao Zedong during the Cultural Revolution, and their actions during that period remain controversial and significant in Chinese history. Kuhn's reporting on their apologies suggests a journalistic focus on accountability, historical reckoning, and the long-term consequences of political movements in China.

This reporting is particularly significant because it highlights an apparent paradox: a Communist Party targeting individuals who identify as Marxists.
