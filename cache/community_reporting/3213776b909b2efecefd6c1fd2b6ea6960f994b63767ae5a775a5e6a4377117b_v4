These connections to Scrooge's past are particularly significant because they represent a time before his current miserly state, suggesting that he was once capable of normal human relationships and professional camaraderie.

The fact that she is specifically identified as a debtor's wife rather than the debtor himself suggests that the consequences of Scrooge's business practices ripple outward to affect innocent family members.
