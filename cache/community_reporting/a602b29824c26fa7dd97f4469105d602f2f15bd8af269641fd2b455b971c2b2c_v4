Prior to the amendment, the two-term limit would have required Xi to step down from the presidency in 2023, following the precedent established by his predecessors.

The relationship between Xi Jinping and the constitutional amendment reveals how institutional changes can be tailored to benefit specific political actors.

This characterization was particularly bold given the sensitivity of constitutional matters and the high-level political figures involved in the reform. Wang's criticism went beyond mere disagreement with policy details; he positioned the amendment as a fundamental step backward for Chinese political culture, suggesting that it undermined previous progress toward more institutionalized and predictable governance structures. His willingness to speak out publicly on such a sensitive issue demonstrated considerable personal courage, as political activism on constitutional matters can carry significant personal and professional risks in China.
