The partnership brings together expertise on state sector transformation and institutional analysis to examine how China has achieved rapid economic growth while maintaining substantial state ownership and control over key industries.

SASAC is the Chinese government agency responsible for managing state-owned enterprises, making it a critical institution in China's economic governance structure. Naughton's research on this topic provides insights into how China has reformed its state-owned enterprises while maintaining government control, a process that has been central to China's economic development strategy since the 1990s.

Understanding institutional adaptation is crucial for explaining how China has avoided the economic stagnation that affected other socialist economies and has instead achieved sustained high growth rates.

By examining this phenomenon through the lens of state capitalism and institutional adaptation, Naughton and Tsai are contributing to broader debates about development economics, the role of the state in economic growth, and the relationship between economic and political liberalization.
