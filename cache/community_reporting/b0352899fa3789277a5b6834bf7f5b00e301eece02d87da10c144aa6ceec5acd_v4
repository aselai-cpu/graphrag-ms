Launched by Mao to reclaim authority within the Communist Party, this movement purported to defend China against capitalist restoration but instead unleashed unprecedented chaos and violence across the nation [Data: Entities (30)]. The revolution resulted in violent purges, millions of deaths, and near civil war conditions throughout China. Senior officials including Liu Shaoqi were purged, and the foreign ministry was particularly devastated, with diplomats forced to abandon professional sophistication for revolutionary fervor to avoid persecution [Data: Entities (30)]. The movement's impact extended beyond political persecution to economic devastation, wiping out economic gains made in the early 1960s and shattering China's economy. Supervisory bodies were dissolved during this period of political chaos, leaving the nation without institutional safeguards against the excesses of revolutionary violence [Data: Entities (30)].

These radical youth groups were particularly identified by their practice of carrying Mao's 'little red book' of quotations, which became a symbol of their devotion to the Chairman and the revolutionary cause. The Red Guards operated as violent vigilantes, targeting what they deemed to be counter-revolutionary elements, class enemies, and bourgeois elements within Chinese society [Data: Entities (161)]. Their methods of persecution were brutal and far-reaching, employing violent struggle sessions where they publicly humiliated and tortured their victims. They used big-character posters (dazibao) as tools to publicly accuse and denounce individuals they identified as class enemies [Data: Entities (161)]. The Red Guards were formed specifically to defend the revolution and carry out Mao's directives during the Cultural Revolution, making them central actors in the movement's violent excesses [Data: Relationships (350)]. By July 1968, Mao himself became involved in events concerning these groups, eventually recognizing that their violent activities had spiraled out of control and threatened social stability.

This campaign represented an attempt to completely erase traditional Chinese culture and replace it with revolutionary ideology [Data: Entities (161), (2609)]. The Red Guards' destructive activities extended beyond individual persecution to include systematic cultural destruction as they rampaged through museums, libraries, and religious sites, deliberately destroying cultural relics and artifacts [Data: Relationships (367)]. This wholesale destruction of cultural heritage represented an irreplaceable loss to Chinese civilization, as countless historical artifacts, religious texts, and cultural treasures were destroyed in the name of revolutionary purity. The campaign against the Four Olds demonstrated how the Cultural Revolution sought not merely political transformation but the complete remaking of Chinese society and culture through the elimination of its historical foundations [Data: Entities (161)].

Among their many victims was Yi Xiaoxiong's father, who was persecuted by these groups, representing just one example of the widespread suffering inflicted during this period [Data: Entities (161)]. The revolution left a particularly complex mark on Xi Jinping, who would later become China's leader. During this period, Xi Jinping and his family were persecuted, with his father Xi Zhongxun being purged. Xi himself was detained, rusticated to Liangjiahe village in Yan'an, and forced to work as a rural laborer while his education was disrupted [Data: Entities (30)]. Other individuals like Pei Yiran were forced to work as construction laborers and schoolteachers in the countryside. Youth of this era had severely limited access to books and education, creating a 'lost generation' whose educational and professional development was severely stunted [Data: Entities (30)]. The movement evoked comparisons to China's later mass indoctrination camps according to contemporary reporting, highlighting the systematic nature of the persecution and ideological control [Data: Entities (30)].
