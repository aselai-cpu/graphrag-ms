The Party operates as a Leninist organization with a hierarchical, mobilizational, and task-oriented structure that reaches into every corner of Chinese society, governing 1.4 billion people through a jealous monopoly on power [Data: Entities (7); Relationships (3)].\\n\\nThe Party's governance mechanisms are comprehensive and multifaceted. It controls the National People's Congress, commands the People's Liberation Army as its armed wing, and exercises prerogative over the legal system, insisting that law is a lever of state power rather than a restraint. The Party establishes party committees and cells within Chinese companies and foreign enterprises operating in China, requiring businesses to conform with its interests [Data: Entities (7)].
