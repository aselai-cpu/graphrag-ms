The fact that Ye Jianying spoke on behalf of China indicates his authoritative role in communicating governmental policy on one of the most sensitive and important issues in Chinese politics. Taiwan reunification remains a fundamental policy goal for the Chinese government, and individuals authorized to make official statements on this matter hold positions of considerable political significance.

Beyond political messaging, China.org.cn also addresses cultural and literary topics, having published content about English translations of Romance of the Three Kingdoms in April 2020. This dual function—combining political communication with cultural promotion—demonstrates the website's role as a comprehensive platform for projecting Chinese governmental perspectives and cultural heritage to both domestic and international audiences. The website's coverage of Romance of the Three Kingdoms, one of China's Four Great Classical Novels, indicates its commitment to promoting understanding of Chinese classical literature in the English-speaking world.

Taiwan reunification represents one of the most significant and sensitive political issues for the Chinese government, classified as a core policy objective that has remained consistent across different periods of Chinese political leadership. The fact that both a political figure and an official website platform are dedicated to communicating on this issue underscores its importance in Chinese governmental priorities. The emphasis on peaceful reunification in Ye Jianying's statements suggests a preference for diplomatic solutions, though the issue remains contentious in international relations.

These two modalities serve different but overlapping functions in the communication ecosystem. Individual political statements carry the weight of personal authority and can be tailored to specific diplomatic or political contexts, while institutional websites provide continuous, accessible platforms for reaching broader audiences over extended periods.

This integration of cultural and political content serves multiple strategic purposes. First, it positions the website as a comprehensive resource on Chinese affairs rather than solely a political propaganda platform, potentially increasing its credibility and appeal to diverse audiences. Second, cultural content about classical literature and heritage can serve soft power objectives by promoting positive perceptions of Chinese civilization and cultural achievements. Third, the combination allows the platform to reach audiences who may be interested in Chinese culture but less engaged with political content, thereby expanding the potential reach of governmental messaging.
