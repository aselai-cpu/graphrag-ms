The Qing Empire had annexed Taiwan in the 1680s, establishing approximately two centuries of Chinese rule over the island [Data: Entities (861); Relationships (2490)]. This long period of Qing administration came to an abrupt end following China's defeat in the Sino-Japanese War. The war, which took place between 1894 and 1895, resulted in Taiwan being ceded to Japan as part of the peace settlement [Data: Entities (863); Relationships (2492)]. This territorial transfer represented not merely an administrative change but a fundamental shift in Taiwan's political status, cultural orientation, and strategic importance in the region. The cession marked the beginning of fifty years of Japanese colonial rule over Taiwan, which would last until the end of World War II in 1945.

However, the empire's defeat in the Sino-Japanese War of 1894-1895 exposed its military weakness and inability to defend its territorial integrity against rising regional powers [Data: Entities (863); Relationships (2492)]. The loss of Taiwan was particularly significant because it demonstrated that the Qing Empire could no longer maintain control over territories it had held for generations. This territorial concession was part of a broader pattern of decline that characterized the late Qing period, during which the empire faced internal rebellions, foreign invasions, and the loss of tributary states. The cession of Taiwan thus served as a visible symbol of China's diminished status in the international order and foreshadowed further territorial losses and concessions that would follow in subsequent decades.\"}, {\"summary\": \"The Sino-Japanese War as a Catalyst for Regional Power Shift\", \"explanation\": \"The Sino-Japanese War of 1894-1895 served as a pivotal catalyst that fundamentally altered the balance of power in East Asia.

The war's outcome forced the Qing Empire to cede Taiwan to Japan, marking a significant territorial transfer that symbolized the shifting power dynamics in the region [Data: Relationships (2492)]. Prior to this conflict, China had been regarded as the dominant power in East Asia, with Japan often viewed as a peripheral player. However, Japan's military success in this war demonstrated its rapid modernization and growing military capabilities, while simultaneously exposing the Qing Empire's weakness and inability to compete with modernized military forces. The war thus represented a turning point in East Asian history, establishing Japan as a rising imperial power capable of challenging and defeating its larger neighbor.

The fact that Taiwan became a key territorial concession following the Sino-Japanese War further underscores its significance in regional power calculations [Data: Relationships (2492)].
