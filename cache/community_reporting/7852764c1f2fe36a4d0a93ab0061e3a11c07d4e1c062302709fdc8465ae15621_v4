The journal has become particularly significant due to its role in highlighting tensions between academic freedom and political censorship. Cambridge University Press, the journal's publisher, was asked to remove certain articles covering sensitive subjects related to China, placing the publication at the center of international debates about scholarly independence. This incident raised fundamental questions about whether academic publishers should comply with censorship requests or maintain their commitment to unrestricted scholarly discourse. The journal's position as a leading platform for research and analysis on Chinese politics, society, history, and culture makes it an important voice in the academic community, and the controversy underscored both its significance as a source of critical scholarship and the challenges faced by academic publications covering politically sensitive material.

These protests are subject to extensive censorship within China, and Chinese authorities have actively sought to suppress academic and public discourse about them both domestically and internationally. The protests were among the topics covered in articles that Chinese authorities requested be removed from The China Quarterly, demonstrating the extent to which the Chinese government attempts to control narratives about this historical event even in foreign academic publications. The relationship between the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests and China reveals the ongoing sensitivity of this historical event, with the Chinese state continuing to view academic discussion of these protests as a threat to its political narrative and legitimacy. This censorship extends beyond China's borders, as evidenced by the pressure placed on international academic publishers to remove content related to these events.

The fact that Chinese authorities continue to seek removal of academic articles about this period from international scholarly publications demonstrates the ongoing political sensitivity surrounding critical examination of this era. The relationship between The China Quarterly and the Cultural Revolution shows how the journal served as a platform for scholarly analysis of this important historical period, and how such academic work can become subject to political pressure. This censorship attempt reveals the Chinese government's desire to control not only contemporary political discourse but also historical narratives about controversial periods in the nation's past.
