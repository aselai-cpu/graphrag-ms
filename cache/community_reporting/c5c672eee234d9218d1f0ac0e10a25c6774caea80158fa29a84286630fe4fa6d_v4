This extended tenure in Fujian allowed Xi to conduct extensive exploration and practice in governance and policy implementation, providing him with comprehensive administrative experience across different levels of provincial government. The province's role as a coastal region at the forefront of China's reform and opening up policies meant that Xi's experience there encompassed managing economic modernization, foreign investment, and market-oriented reforms. During this period, Xi developed a business-friendly record and actively courted ethnic Chinese entrepreneurs, contributing to Fujian's economic success [Data: Entities (224)]. The province's intellectual infrastructure, including the Fujian Provincial Committee Party School, published Xi's work, helping to document and disseminate his political philosophy [Data: Entities (224)].

Xi Jinping's three-year tenure as vice mayor of Xiamen, beginning on his thirty-second birthday, provided him with valuable experience in managing urban development and implementing reform policies in a dynamic coastal city [Data: Entities (225)]. The city's strategic importance as a port facility made it crucial for international trade and foreign investment, which were key components of China's reform policies initiated in the late 1970s and 1980s [Data: Entities (225)]. During his time in Xiamen, Xi was not only appointed as vice mayor but was also nominated for the position of mayor by municipal lawmakers, demonstrating his rising political prominence and the confidence placed in his leadership abilities [Data: Entities (225)]. Xiamen's location in Fujian province positioned it as a significant commercial hub, and it housed important business entities such as the Yuanhua Group [Data: Entities (225); Relationships (529)].

The challenging conditions in this impoverished region provided Xi with practical experience in rural governance and economic development under difficult circumstances [Data: Entities (230)]. Notably, during his tenure in Ningde, Xi focused significantly on anti-corruption efforts, working to address corruption issues as part of his broader governance initiatives [Data: Entities (230)]. This emphasis on combating corruption in Ningde would become a defining theme throughout Xi's subsequent political career, eventually culminating in the massive anti-corruption campaigns he would launch after assuming national leadership. Zhang Mingqing documented Xi's anti-corruption efforts in Ningde through articles published in People's Daily and People.cn, helping to establish Xi's reputation as a leader committed to clean governance [Data: Entities (1420); Relationships (4153)].
