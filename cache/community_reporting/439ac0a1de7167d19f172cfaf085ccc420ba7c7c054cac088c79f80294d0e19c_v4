Millward's scholarship and public commentary have attracted considerable attention, both from academic circles and from Chinese governmental institutions.

This conflict manifests through the direct targeting of Millward's writings by a researcher affiliated with the Ministry of Culture and Tourism, representing an official Chinese governmental response to academic criticism [Data: Relationships (2147)]. The nature of this conflict extends beyond simple academic disagreement, as it involves a sovereign government's ministry actively working to counter the scholarship of a foreign academic. This dynamic illustrates how academic research on sensitive topics can become flashpoints for international tensions, particularly when such research challenges official governmental narratives about human rights, ethnic minorities, and domestic policies. The fact that these attacks have been published in Historical Review suggests an organized effort to use academic or quasi-academic channels to discredit Millward's work [Data: Entities (756)].
