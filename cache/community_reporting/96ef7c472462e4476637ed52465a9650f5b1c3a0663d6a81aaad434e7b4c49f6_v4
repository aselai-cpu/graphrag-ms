The community reveals a significant transformation of China's military establishment during Xi's first term, characterized by an extensive purge that investigated thousands of corruption cases and fundamentally altered the composition and power dynamics within the PLA. The military purge targeted high-level officers while simultaneously restructuring the PLA Ground Force, which historically dominated military leadership but saw its proportional representation significantly reduced as part of broader military reforms.\", \"findings\": [{\"summary\": \"Unprecedented Scale of Xi's Military Anti-Corruption Campaign\", \"explanation\": \"Xi's military purge represents one of the most extensive anti-corruption campaigns in modern Chinese military history, demonstrating the leadership's commitment to reforming the armed forces. The campaign investigated more than four thousand cases during Xi's first term, resulting in punishments for thirteen thousand people [Data: Entities (910)]. The scope of this purge extended to the highest levels of military leadership, with over one hundred high-level officers being punished [Data: Entities (910)]. This massive undertaking was personally conducted by Xi Jinping during his first term, establishing his authority over the military establishment [Data: Relationships (2690)]. The scale and intensity of these investigations suggest deep-rooted corruption within the military structure that required systematic intervention.

Before the reforms, the PLA Ground Force accounted for seven of eleven members on the Central Military Commission, giving the army component dominant representation in the highest military decision-making body [Data: Entities (901)]. Additionally, the Ground Force comprised 70 percent of all PLA personnel, making it by far the largest component of China's armed forces [Data: Entities (901)]. However, Xi's reforms deliberately reduced this dominance, bringing the Ground Force's proportion below 50 percent of total PLA personnel [Data: Entities (901)]. This restructuring represents a fundamental shift in military power dynamics, moving away from traditional army dominance toward a more balanced force structure. The reduction in both leadership representation and personnel proportions suggests a strategic reorientation of China's military capabilities, potentially emphasizing other service branches such as the navy, air force, and strategic support forces to meet modern security challenges.\"}, {\"summary\": \"Consolidation of Xi Jinping's Military Authority\", \"explanation\": \"The military purge served as a critical mechanism for Xi Jinping to consolidate personal authority over the armed forces during his first term. By personally conducting an anti-corruption campaign that investigated over four thousand cases, Xi established direct oversight of military affairs and demonstrated his willingness to challenge entrenched interests [Data: Relationships (2690); Entities (910)]. The targeting of over one hundred high-level officers removed potential rivals and opponents while creating opportunities to install loyalists in key positions [Data: Entities (910)]. This consolidation of authority represents a significant shift in civil-military relations, strengthening the Communist Party's control over the military through Xi's personal leadership. The campaign's timing during Xi's first term was strategically important, allowing him to establish dominance early in his tenure and set the tone for his leadership style. The combination of anti-corruption measures with structural reforms created a comprehensive transformation that extended Xi's influence throughout the military hierarchy.\"}, {\"summary\": \"Transformation of Military Leadership Composition\", \"explanation\": \"The restructuring of the Central Military Commission's composition reflects broader changes in how China's military leadership is organized and balanced across service branches. The PLA Ground Force's reduction from seven of eleven seats on the Central Military Commission represents a deliberate effort to create more equitable representation among different military services [Data: Entities (901)]. This change in leadership composition likely enhanced the influence of other service branches, including the navy, air force, and newer components like the Strategic Support Force. The restructuring of this key decision-making body suggests a modernization of military command structures to better reflect contemporary warfare requirements and strategic priorities. By reducing army dominance in military leadership, the reforms positioned China's armed forces to better address modern security challenges that require integrated capabilities across multiple domains.

Simultaneously, the reduction of PLA Ground Force dominance from 70 percent to below 50 percent of total personnel represented a fundamental reorganization of force structure [Data: Entities (901)]. This dual approach allowed Xi to remove corrupt officers while justifying broader organizational changes as necessary for military modernization. The integration of these strategies made it difficult for opponents to resist reforms without appearing to defend corruption or oppose modernization. The PLA Ground Force, as a component of the broader PLA structure, experienced these changes as part of the overall transformation of China's military establishment [Data: Relationships (2668); Entities (901)].
