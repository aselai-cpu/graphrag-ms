The CCDI operates largely outside China's formal legal system, possessing extraordinary powers including the ability to seize evidence without warrants and detain suspects indefinitely through the shuanggui detention process [Data: Entities (337)]. Under Xi's leadership, the organization has been transformed into what some describe as an ideological inquisitor, conducting political health checks on officials and punishing deviations from Xi's directives [Data: Entities (337)].\\n\\nThe CCDI's authority has been both expanded and centralized under Xi. For investigations and punishments of officials at vice-ministerial rank or higher, the CCDI must secure Xi's personal approval, demonstrating the paramount leader's direct control over high-level disciplinary actions [Data: Entities (337)].

He was cashiered in April 2020 and subsequently expelled from the Communist Party, facing criminal charges including taking bribes, manipulating securities markets, and illegally possessing firearms [Data: Entities (470)].

As Vice Minister of the Ministry of Public Security and President of Interpol, Meng disappeared during a work trip to Beijing in September 2018 [Data: Entities (462); Relationships (1259)]. He was subsequently investigated by the National Supervisory Commission, expelled from the Communist Party, and sentenced to 13.5 years in prison for bribery charges [Data: Entities (462)].

As a former Politburo Standing Committee member who oversaw China's security services, Zhou was formally investigated in July 2014 for corruption and abuse of power [Data: Entities (305); Relationships (772)]. His investigation was particularly significant as he was a retired Standing Committee member, breaking an unofficial precedent that top leaders of this rank were immune from prosecution [Data: Entities (305)].
