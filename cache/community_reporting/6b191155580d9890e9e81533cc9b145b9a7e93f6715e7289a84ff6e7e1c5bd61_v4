The collapse of communist rule across the region marked the end of an era and represented a significant geopolitical shift with implications for remaining socialist states. The Chinese government's concern over these developments likely stemmed from fears that similar political movements could inspire domestic challenges to its own socialist system [Data: Entities (35)].\\n\\nThe fall of socialist regimes in Eastern Europe occurred in conjunction with the collapse of the Soviet Union, creating a cascading effect across the Soviet bloc.
