This dual nature of government ownership combined with the publication of anti-government content makes Wujie a particularly noteworthy entity within China's media landscape.

The immediate response to this publication was swift and severe: Wujie was shut down, and individuals affiliated with the media venture were rounded up [Data: Entities (1204)].

The fact that a regional government entity had an ownership stake in a media outlet that engaged in such politically sensitive activities suggests either a failure of control mechanisms or possible factional politics at play. Following the incident, the regional government would likely have faced scrutiny from central authorities regarding how a media venture under its partial ownership could publish such content.

The rounding up of these individuals likely included journalists, editors, management staff, and potentially even technical or administrative personnel who may have had no direct involvement in the editorial decision to publish the anti-Xi letter. This approach reflects the Chinese government's strategy of creating a chilling effect throughout the media industry by demonstrating that association with politically sensitive content can result in severe personal consequences.
