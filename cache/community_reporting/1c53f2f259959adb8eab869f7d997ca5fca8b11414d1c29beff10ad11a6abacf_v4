This international recognition reflected the geopolitical realities of the early Cold War period, when Western nations and their allies were reluctant to recognize the Communist government in Beijing. The Nationalist Government's control over Taiwan allowed it to maintain its claim as the legitimate government of all China, even though its actual territorial control was limited to the island and a few small offshore islands. This situation of dual claims to legitimacy persisted for decades and shaped international diplomacy, United Nations representation, and regional security arrangements throughout the Cold War era.
