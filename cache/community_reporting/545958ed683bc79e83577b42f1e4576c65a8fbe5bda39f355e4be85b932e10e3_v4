Hu served as China's leader for approximately 10 years, during which he oversaw the country's economy and preceded Xi Jinping in the leadership succession [Data: Entities (275); Relationships (856)]. However, Hu's tenure has been critically characterized as a 'lost decade' marked by policy gridlock, missed opportunities for reform, tentative reforms, and sloganeering that emphasized concepts like 'harmonious society' [Data: Entities (275)].
