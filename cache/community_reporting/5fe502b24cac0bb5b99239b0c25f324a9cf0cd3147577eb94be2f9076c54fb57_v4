The Qing government's response to these reform efforts was brutally repressive, executing six intellectuals who championed the political reforms, an event that became known as the execution of the six gentlemen of Wuxu [Data: Entities (110, 112); Relationships (242)]. This harsh treatment of reformers exemplified the conservative faction's grip on power within the Qing government and its fundamental resistance to the modernization efforts that many believed were necessary for China's survival [Data: Entities (110)].
