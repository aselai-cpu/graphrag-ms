The network includes Ambassador Cui, who was identified as responsible for Zhao Lijian's team, and represents a significant instance of social media-based diplomatic conflict between U.S. and Chinese officials over sensitive issues of race and racism.

This confrontation centered on Zhao Lijian's comments about Washington, D.C., which Rice perceived as racist and inappropriate for a diplomatic official to make publicly. The incident is particularly notable because it demonstrates the use of social media as a venue for direct diplomatic confrontation between officials from major world powers. Rather than relying on traditional diplomatic channels or private communications, Rice chose to publicly rebuke the Chinese diplomat, bringing international attention to the issue. This approach reflects a broader trend in modern diplomacy where social media platforms serve as both battlegrounds for ideological conflicts and forums for public accountability.
