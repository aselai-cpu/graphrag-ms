This biographical work represents an important contribution to understanding China's diplomatic evolution, tracing a career that began in the revolutionary base of Yan'an and extended to the highest levels of international diplomacy at the United Nations. The publication of such diplomatic memoirs serves multiple purposes: it preserves the institutional memory of China's foreign relations, provides insights into the development of Chinese diplomacy over several decades, and documents the experiences of individuals who shaped China's international engagement.
