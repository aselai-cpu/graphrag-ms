This corruption case at such a senior level raises questions about institutional oversight and accountability mechanisms within the PLA's command structure.

This succession pattern reveals several important aspects of Chinese military leadership selection. First, it shows that combat experience, particularly from the pivotal 1979 conflict, remains a valued credential for senior military appointments even decades after the war's conclusion. Second, it demonstrates the system's capacity to maintain institutional continuity despite high-level corruption scandals by drawing upon a pool of experienced military leaders with proven combat records. The selection of a Sino-Vietnamese War veteran to replace a disgraced senior officer suggests that Chinese leadership prioritizes both professional military competence and, presumably, perceived integrity when filling critical positions in the wake of corruption cases.
