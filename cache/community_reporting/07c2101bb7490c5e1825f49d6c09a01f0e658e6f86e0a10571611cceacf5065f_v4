Bloomberg published an exposé revealing that members of Xi Jinping's extended family had accumulated significant wealth since the 1990s, with specific reporting on Xi Jinping's millionaire relations published in June 2012 [Data: Entities (2572, 249); Relationships (6975, 606)]. This investigation was particularly significant as it examined the financial affairs of China's most powerful political figure at a sensitive time in Chinese politics. Mike Forsythe, a Bloomberg reporter, played a central role in co-authoring this exposé, demonstrating the collaborative nature of this investigative effort [Data: Entities (1227); Relationships (3796)]. The investigation represented major investigative journalism that drew international attention and established Bloomberg News as an organization willing to publish sensitive stories about Chinese leadership despite potential consequences.

In 2013, Bloomberg News reporters encountered visa threats in China, indicating the government's displeasure with the organization's coverage [Data: Entities (249)]. More severely, Bloomberg News had at least one staffer detained in China on national security grounds, though this individual was later released, highlighting the serious personal risks faced by journalists working on China-related stories [Data: Entities (249)]. These incidents of retaliation represent a pattern of pressure designed to discourage critical journalism about Chinese leadership and their families. Interestingly, despite the sensitive nature of his reporting, Mike Forsythe was not expelled from China immediately after the exposé, and his China journalist visa was renewed in 2013, representing an unusual outcome given typical Chinese government responses to such critical reporting [Data: Entities (1227)].
