His leadership was characterized by a comprehensive approach to nation-building that addressed both external relations and internal social cohesion. Under his guidance, Singapore underwent a remarkable transformation from a third world country to a first world nation, a journey he documented in his book published by HarperCollins [Data: Entities (1118, 2442); Relationships (6683)]. Lee Kuan Yew's vision extended beyond economic development to encompass the creation of a distinct Singaporean identity that drew from Asian heritage while charting a unique path in the modern world. His policies and leadership style became a model studied by developing nations worldwide, demonstrating how effective governance, social stability, and strategic economic planning could enable rapid national advancement.

As Prime Minister, he was instrumental in formulating Singapore's foreign policy framework, particularly toward China, one of the region's most significant powers [Data: Entities (1118); Relationships (3417)]. His pragmatic approach to great power relations was evident in his significant interactions with Chinese leaders, including a notable meeting with Mao Zedong in 1976 and Deng Xiaoping in 1978. During his meeting with Deng Xiaoping, Lee Kuan Yew conveyed a crucial message about Chinese Singaporeans forging their own destiny separate from mainland China, which was instrumental in establishing Singapore's distinct national identity and ensuring the loyalty of its Chinese population to their new nation rather than their ancestral homeland [Data: Entities (1118)]. Lee Kuan Yew's diplomatic acumen was further demonstrated at the 1973 Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting held in Ottawa, where he addressed Singapore's strategic challenges in the context of great power relations [Data: Entities (1118, 1126, 2444); Relationships (3430, 6667)].

This advocacy represented his belief that Asian societies required different governance approaches than those promoted by Western democracies, emphasizing communal harmony, social discipline, and economic development over individual rights and political freedoms as understood in the Western context [Data: Entities (1118)]. His promotion of Asian values had a particularly strong impact on older Chinese Singaporeans, shaping their worldview and cultural identity [Data: Entities (1118); Relationships (3417)]. This ideological stance made Lee Kuan Yew a controversial but influential figure in international political discourse, as it challenged the universality of Western democratic values and proposed an alternative model of governance rooted in Asian cultural traditions. His advocacy for Asian values was not merely theoretical but was embedded in Singapore's policy framework, influencing everything from social policies to educational approaches.
