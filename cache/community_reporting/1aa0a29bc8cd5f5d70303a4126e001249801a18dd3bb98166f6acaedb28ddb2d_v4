This metaphorical framework provides a powerful analytical tool for understanding a specific form of corruption involving privileged connections and influence-peddling. The steroid metaphor is particularly apt because it captures the dual nature of this phenomenon: just as steroids can enhance athletic performance in the short term while causing long-term health damage, access money can accelerate economic growth temporarily while undermining institutional integrity and sustainable development over time. This concept helps distinguish between different types of corrupt practices and their varying impacts on economic systems. By identifying access money as a distinct category of corruption, Ang enables more precise analysis of how informal networks, political connections, and privileged access to resources and opportunities shape economic outcomes.

This work challenges simplistic narratives that assume corruption always impedes economic development, demonstrating instead that the relationship between corruption and growth is more complex than commonly understood. The book's title itself evokes historical parallels to America's Gilded Age, suggesting similarities in how rapid economic expansion can coexist with significant governance challenges and corrupt practices. Through her analysis, Ang provides insights into the specific mechanisms by which certain forms of corruption may not prevent—and may even facilitate—economic growth under particular conditions, while still recognizing the long-term costs and risks associated with such practices. This research contributes to broader theoretical debates about institutional quality, state capacity, and the conditions under which economic development occurs.

Her research on corruption and development requires integrating insights from economics, political science, sociology, and area studies.

Her comparative approach, which examines governance and corruption across different national contexts, provides valuable insights into how institutional arrangements, political systems, and economic structures interact in various settings.
