The use of Hong Kong customs as the mechanism for the seizure provided China with a degree of separation while still sending a clear political message.

China's sensitivity to any foreign military engagement with Taiwan stems from its view of Taiwan as a breakaway province that must eventually be reunified with the mainland. Singapore's continued military training in Taiwan, despite this sensitivity, represents a challenge to China's preferred international approach to Taiwan.
