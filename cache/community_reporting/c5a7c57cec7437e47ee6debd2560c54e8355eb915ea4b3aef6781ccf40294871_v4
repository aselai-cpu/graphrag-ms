The community represents a critical geopolitical transition that ended over 150 years of British colonial rule and established the framework for Hong Kong's governance under Chinese sovereignty. The Sino-British Joint Declaration established the terms for the handover and introduced the 'one country, two systems' formula, while the Hong Kong Handover itself marked the actual transfer of control.
