Leadership transitions represent potentially vulnerable moments for authoritarian regimes, as they can expose succession crises, factional conflicts, or legitimacy challenges. By focusing on how authoritarian systems demonstrate resilience during these transitions, Jiangnan Zhu and Nikolai Mukhin address fundamental questions about regime stability and survival. Their work likely examines the institutional mechanisms, elite bargaining processes, and legitimation strategies that allow authoritarian governments to maintain control despite changes in top leadership.
