Described as a grey-haired rascal nearly seventy years old, he conducts his illicit business while smoking his pipe by a charcoal stove, suggesting a casual and established operation [Data: Entities (140)]. His shop functions as the central hub where stolen goods are bought and sold, making him the essential link between thieves and the black market [Data: Entities (143); Relationships (339)]. Old Joe's role as proprietor and operator of this establishment positions him as the kingpin of this small criminal network, as he directly purchases stolen goods from multiple sources including the charwoman [Data: Relationships (327)]. The fact that he maintains relationships with multiple thieves simultaneously indicates this is not an opportunistic venture but rather a systematic criminal enterprise.

These three individuals are all involved in the same theft, as evidenced by their mutual recognition when meeting at Old Joe's shop [Data: Relationships (330, 332)]. The charwoman enters the shop first, carrying a heavy bundle of stolen items, establishing the pattern of the criminal activity [Data: Entities (141); Relationships (327)]. Mrs. Dilber, working as a laundress, brings stolen household linens and personal effects including sheets, towels, silver teaspoons, sugar-tongs, and boots, indicating she had access to domestic areas of the victim's property [Data: Entities (24)]. The undertaker's man, dressed in faded black, brings items of a more personal nature including seals, a pencil-case, sleeve-buttons, and a brooch [Data: Entities (142); Relationships (344)]. The division of stolen goods among the three thieves suggests either a planned distribution of the spoils or that each had access to different areas of the victim's estate.

This establishment serves as the meeting point for all members of the criminal network, with the undertaker's man entering to sell stolen items and the charwoman bringing her heavy bundle of pilfered goods [Data: Relationships (344, 327)]. The shop's role as a central hub is evidenced by its connections to all other entities in the network, making it the physical location where criminal transactions are consummated [Data: Relationships (339)]. The variety of goods handled by the shop—from household items to personal effects and valuables—indicates that Old Joe is willing to purchase virtually any stolen property, making his establishment an attractive destination for thieves.

The undertaker's man, whose occupation would grant him legitimate access to the deceased and their belongings, abuses this position of trust to steal personal items including seals, a pencil-case, sleeve-buttons, and a brooch [Data: Entities (142); Relationships (344)]. Similarly, Mrs. Dilber, working as a laundress with access to household linens and domestic spaces, exploits her professional position to steal sheets, towels, and valuable items like silver teaspoons and sugar-tongs [Data: Entities (24)]. The charwoman, who would typically have access to a household for cleaning purposes, uses her position to pilfer a heavy bundle of items [Data: Entities (141)]. This pattern reveals a systematic abuse of professional trust, where individuals in service positions exploit their access to steal from those they are supposed to serve. The fact that all three individuals are involved in the same theft suggests they may have coordinated their efforts, with each using their specific access privileges to maximize the haul.
