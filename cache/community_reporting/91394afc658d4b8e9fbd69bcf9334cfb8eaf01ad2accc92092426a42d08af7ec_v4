Tiffert, working as a China historian at Stanford University's Hoover Institution, conducted research that identified systematic omissions of sensitive articles from digitized Chinese legal journals [Data: Entities (768); Relationships (2181)]. His findings revealed patterns of censorship in digital archives, demonstrating how politically sensitive content has been deliberately excluded from online collections of Chinese legal publications [Data: Entities (768)]. This research has significant implications for scholars and researchers who rely on digital databases for accessing Chinese legal and historical documents, as it highlights the incomplete and potentially misleading nature of digitized historical records from China [Data: Entities (768)].

Most notably, he experienced a situation where archive officials denied him access to documents that he had previously been able to read and consult, highlighting the evolving and sometimes arbitrary nature of archival access in China [Data: Entities (766)]. This experience demonstrates how permissions and availability of historical materials can change unpredictably, even for documents that were once accessible to scholars, creating significant obstacles for academic research [Data: Entities (766)].
