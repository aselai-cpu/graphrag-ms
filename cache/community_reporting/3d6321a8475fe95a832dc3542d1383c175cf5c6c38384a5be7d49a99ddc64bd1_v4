The community structure is characterized by a hub-and-spoke pattern, with Xinhua News Agency serving as the central node connecting all four authors.

This pattern suggests a coordinated journalistic effort typical of major state media organizations covering significant political developments.

This elevated connectivity suggests that Wu Huanqing may hold a more senior or central role in the journalistic team, potentially serving as a lead author or having broader professional connections within the organization.

All four journalists—Wu Huanqing, Zou Wei, Wang Min, and Sun Shaolong—are specifically identified as authors of content about this resolution [Data: Entities (1958, 1959, 1961, 1962)]. The fact that Xinhua News Agency deployed multiple journalists to cover this topic suggests the resolution's importance and the need for comprehensive reporting. Central Committee resolutions typically represent major policy decisions or historical assessments by China's ruling party, making them subjects of national and international interest.
