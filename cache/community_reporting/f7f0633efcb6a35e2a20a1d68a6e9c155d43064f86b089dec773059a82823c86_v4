The community consists of three core entities: Russia as the annexing state, Crimea as the annexed territory, and the 2014 Annexation event itself that connects them. The annexation fundamentally altered the territorial status of the Crimean peninsula, which had previously been part of Ukraine, through a controversial referendum and military intervention that drew international condemnation. This action has created lasting tensions in international relations, with most countries and international organizations refusing to recognize Russian sovereignty over Crimea and continuing to regard it as Ukrainian territory under Russian occupation.\", \"findings\": [{\"summary\": \"Crimea as a contested territory with altered geopolitical status\", \"explanation\": \"Crimea represents a geographic location and territory whose status was fundamentally transformed in 2014 when it was annexed by Russia. Prior to this annexation, Crimea was part of Ukraine, making this territorial change a significant violation of international norms regarding sovereignty and territorial integrity [Data: Entities (945); Relationships (2807)]. The peninsula's incorporation into the Russian Federation followed a controversial referendum and military intervention, processes that were widely criticized by the international community as illegitimate. The annexation has created a situation where Crimea's legal status remains disputed, with the territory existing in a state of limbo between Russian de facto control and continued international recognition as Ukrainian territory.

The annexation demonstrated Russia's strategic interest in maintaining control over the Crimean peninsula, which hosts the strategically important Black Sea Fleet naval base in Sevastopol. Russia's actions in Crimea involved deploying military forces, often referred to as 'little green men' due to their unmarked uniforms, to take control of key infrastructure and government buildings before organizing a referendum on joining Russia. The annexation has had profound consequences for Russia's international standing, resulting in economic sanctions from Western countries, diplomatic isolation on this issue, and a fundamental deterioration in relations with Ukraine and much of the Western world.

The annexation process involved multiple stages, including the deployment of Russian military forces, the organization of a controversial referendum in which Crimean residents voted to join Russia, and the subsequent formal incorporation of the territory into the Russian Federation. The speed and coordination of these actions suggested extensive planning and preparation by Russian authorities. The 2014 Annexation has been characterized by international legal scholars and most governments as a violation of international law, particularly the principles of territorial integrity and sovereignty enshrined in the United Nations Charter. The event triggered immediate international responses, including economic sanctions against Russia, the suspension of Russia from the G8 (transforming it back to the G7), and a fundamental reassessment of European security architecture.
