The description of the Poor Law as 'very busy' implies significant demand for its services, reflecting either widespread poverty or active enforcement of its provisions.

The characterization of Scrooge's belief that the Poor Law is 'in useful operation' indicates he viewed the system as functioning effectively and serving its intended purpose.
